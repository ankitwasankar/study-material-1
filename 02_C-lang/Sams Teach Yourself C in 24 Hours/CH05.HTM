<P>I/O, I/O, it's off to work we go…</P>
<P><B>–The Seven Dwarfs (sort of)</B></P>
<P>In the last lesson you learned how to print out characters, integers, and floating-point
numbers to the screen by calling the printf() function. In this lesson you're going
to learn more about printf(), as well as about the following functions, which are
necessary to receive the input from the user or print the output to the screen:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The getc() function
	<LI>The putc() function
	<LI>The getchar() function
	<LI>The putchar() function
</UL>

<P>Before we jump into these new functions, let's first get an idea about the standard
input and output in C.</P>
<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 2"></A>The Standard Input and Output (I/O)</H3>
<P>A file contains related characters and numbers. Because all characters and numbers
are represented in bits on computers, the C language treats a file as a series of
bytes. (8 bits make up 1 byte.) A series of bytes is also called a stream. In fact,
the C language treats all file streams equally, although some of the file streams
may come from a disk or tape drive, from a terminal, or even from a printer.</P>
<P>Additionally, in C, there are three file streams that are pre-opened for you:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>stdin–The standard input for reading.
	<LI>stdout–The standard output for writing.
	<LI>stderr–The standard error for writing error messages.
</UL>

<P>Usually, the standard input (stdin) file stream links to your keyboard, while
the standard output (stdout) and the standard error (stderr) file streams point to
your terminal screen. Also, many operating systems allow you to redirect these files'
streams.</P>
<P>In fact, you've already used stdout. When you executed the printf() function in
the last lesson, you were in fact sending the output to the default file stream,
stdout, which points to your screen.</P>
<P>You'll learn more on stdin and stdout in the following sections.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 3"></A>Getting the Input from the User</H3>
<P>In these days, typing from keyboard is still the de facto standard way to input
information into computers. The C language has several functions to direct the computer
to read the input from the user (typically through the keyboard.) In this lesson
the getc() and getchar() functions are introduced.</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 4"></A>Using the getc() Function</H4>
<P>The getc() function reads the next character from a file stream, and returns the
character as an integer.</P>

<P><A NAME="PAGENUM-53"></A></P>

<P>The syntax for the getc() function is</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int getc(FILE *stream);

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>Here FILE *stream declares a file stream (that is, a variable). The function returns
the numeric value of the character read. If an end-of-file or error occurs, the function
returns EOF.</P>
<P>At this moment, don't worry about the FILE structure. More details about it are
introduced in Hours 21, &quot;Disk File Input and Output: Part I,&quot; and 22, &quot;Disk
File Input and Output: Part II.&quot; In this section, the standard input stdin is
used as the file stream specified by FILE *stream.</P>

Defined in the header file stdio.h, EOF is a constant. EOF stands for end-of-file.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>OUTPUT</B><BR>
	You see in line 2 of Listing 5.1 that the header file stdio.h is included for both
	the getc() and printf() functions used in the program. Lines 4_12 give the name and
	body of the main() function.
	<P><B>ANALYSIS</B><BR>
	In line 6, an integer variable, ch, is declared; it is assigned the return value
	from the getc() function later in line 9. Line 8 prints out a piece of message that
	asks the user to enter one character from the keyboard. As I mentioned earlier in
	this lesson, the printf() function in line 8 uses the default standard output stdout
	to display messages on the screen.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In line 9, the standard input stdin is passed to the getc() function, which indicates
that the file stream is from the keyboard. After the user types in a character, the
getc() function returns the numeric value (that is, an integer) of the character.
You see that, in line 9, the numeric value is assigned to the integer variable ch.</P>
<P>Then, in line 10, the character entered by the user is displayed on the screen
with the help of printf(). Note that the character format specifier (%c) is used
within the printf() function in line 10. (Exercise 1 in this lesson asks you to use
%d in a program to print out the numeric value of a character entered by the user.)</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 5"></A>Using the getchar() Function</H4>
<P>The C language provides another function, getchar(), to perform a similar operation
to getc(). More precisely, the getchar() function is equivalent to getc(stdin).</P>
<P>The syntax for the getchar() function is</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int getchar(void);

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>Here void indicates that no argument is needed for calling the function. The function
<BR>
returns the numeric value of the character read. If an end-of-file or error occurs,
the function returns EOF.</P>

<P>The program in Listing 5.2 demonstrates how to use the getchar() function to read
the input from the user.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>ANALYSIS</B><BR>
	The program in Listing 5.2 is quite similar to the one in Listing 5.1, except that
	the former reads in two characters.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The statement in line 6 declares two integers, ch1 and ch2. Line 8 displays a
message asking the user to enter two characters together.</P>
<P>Then, the getc() and getchar() functions are called in lines 9 and 10, respectively,
to read in two characters entered by the user. Note that in line 10, nothing is passed
to the getchar() function. This is because, as mentioned earlier, getchar() has its
default file stream–stdin. You can replace the getchar() function in line 10 with
getc(stdin), because getc(stdin) is equivalent to getchar().</P>
<P>Lines 11 and 12 send two characters (kept by ch1 and ch2, respectively) to the
screen.</P>
<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 6"></A>Printing the Output on the Screen</H3>
<P>Besides getc() and getchar() for reading, the C language also provides two functions,
putc() and putchar(), for writing. The following two sections introduce these functions.</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 7"></A>Using the putc() Function</H4>
<P>The putc() function writes a character to the specified file stream, which, in
our case, is the standard output pointing to your screen.</P>
<P>The syntax for the putc() function is</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int putc(int c, FILE *stream);

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>Here the first argument, int c, indicates that the output is a character saved
in an integer variable c; the second argument, FILE *stream, specifies a file stream.
If successful, putc() returns the character written; otherwise, it returns EOF.</P>
<P>In this lesson the standard output stdout is used to be the specified file stream
in putc().</P>
<P>The putc() function is used in Listing 5.3 to put the character A on the screen.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>OUTPUT</B><BR>
	The following is what I get from my machine:

The character that has numeric value of 65 is:

A

C:\app&gt;

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
	<P><B>ANALYSIS</B><BR>
	As mentioned, the header file stdio.h, containing the declaration of putc(), is included
	in line 2.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The integer variable, ch, declared in line 6, is assigned the numeric value of
65 in line 8. You may remember that 65 is the numeric value of character A.</P>
<P>Line 9 displays a message to remind the user of the numeric value of the character
that is going to be put on the screen. Then, the putc() function in line 10 puts
character A on the screen. Note that the first argument to the putc() function is
the integer variable (ch) that contains 65, and the second argument is the standard
output file stream, stdout.</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 8"></A>Another Function for Writing: putchar()</H4>
<P>Like putc(), putchar() can also be used to put a character on the screen. The
only difference between the two functions is that putchar() needs only one argument
to contain the character. You don't need to specify the file stream, because the
standard output (stdout) is the default file stream to putchar().</P>
<P>The syntax for the putchar() function is</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int putchar(int c);

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>Here int c is the argument that contains the numeric value of a character. The
function returns EOF if an error occurs; otherwise, it returns the character that
has been written.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>OUTPUT</B><BR>
	After running the executable file, 05L04.exe, I get the following output:
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->

C:\app&gt;

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
	<P><B>ANALYSIS</B><BR>
	The way to write the program in Listing 5.4 is a little bit different. There is no
	variable declared in the program. Rather, integers are passed to putchar() directly,
	as shown in lines 6_11.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As you might have figured out, 65, 66, and 67 are, respectively, the numeric values
of characters A, B, and C. From exercise 5 of Hour 4, &quot;Data Types and Names
in C,&quot; or from Appendix C, &quot;ASCII Character Set,&quot; you can find out
that 10 is the numeric value of the newline character (\n).</P>

<P>Therefore, respectively, lines 6 and 7 put character A on the screen and cause
the computer to start at the beginning of the next line. Likewise, line 8 puts B
on the screen, and line 9 starts a new line. Then, line 10 puts C on the screen,
and line 11 starts another new line. Accordingly, A, B, and C, are put at the beginnings
of three consecutive lines, as shown in the output section.</P>
<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 9"></A>Revisiting the printf() Function</H3>
<P>The printf() function is the first C library function you used in this book to
print out messages on the screen. printf() is a very important function in C, so
it's worth it to spend more time on it.</P>
<P>The syntax for the printf() function is</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int printf(const char *format-string, ...);

</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>Here const char *format-string is the first argument that contains the format
specifier(s); ... indicates the expression section that contains the expression(s)
to be formatted according to the format specifiers. The number of expressions is
determined by the number of the format specifiers inside the first argument. The
function returns the numbers of expressions formatted if it succeeds. It returns
a negative value if an error occurs.</P>
<P>const char * is explained later in this book. For the time being, consider the
first argument to the printf() function as a series of characters surrounded with
double quotes with some format specifiers inside. For instance, you can pass &quot;The
sum of two integers %d + %d is: %d.\n&quot; to the function as the first argument,
if needed.</P>
<P>Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between the format string and expressions. Note
that the format specifiers and the expressions are matched in order from left to
right.</P>

<P>Among the format specifiers in this list, %c, %d, %f, %e, and %E have been introduced
so far. Several others are explained later in this book. The next section shows you
how to convert decimal numbers to hexadecimal numbers by using %x or %X.</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 10"></A>Converting to Hex Numbers</H4>
<P>The difference between a decimal number and a hexadecimal number is that the hexadecimal
is a base-16 numbering system. A hexadecimal number can be represented by four bits.
(2<SUP>4</SUP> is equal to 16, which means four bits can produce 16 unique numbers.)
Hexadecimal is often written as hex for short.</P>

<P>The hexadecimal numbers 0 through 9 use the same numeric symbols founded in the
decimal numbers 0 through 9. uppercase A, B, C, D, E, and F are used to represent,
respectively, the hexadecimal numbers 10 through 15. (Similarly, in lowercase, a,
b, c, d, e, and f are used to represent these hex numbers.)</P>

<P>Listing 5.5 provides an example of converting decimal numbers to hex numbers by
using %x or %X in the printf() function.</P>

	Don't panic when you see so many printf() functions being used in Listing 5.5. In
	fact, the program in Listing 5.5 is very simple. The program has just one function
	body from lines 5_23.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The printf() function in line 6 prints out a headline that contains three fields:
Hex(uppercase), Hex(lowercase), and Decimal.</P>
<P>Then, lines 7_22 print out the hex and decimal numbers 0 through 15. Sixteen printf()
functions are called to accomplish the job. Each of the printf() functions has a
format string as the first argument followed by three integers as three expressions.
Note that the hex format specifiers %X and %x are used within the format string in
each of the printf() functions to convert the corresponding expressions to the hex
format (both uppercase and lowercase).</P>
<P>In reality, nobody would write a program like the one in Listing 5.5. Instead,
a loop can be used to call the printf() function repeatedly. Looping (or iteration)
is introduced in Hour 7, &quot;Doing the Same Thing Over and Over.&quot;</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 11"></A>Adding the Minimum Field Width</H4>
<P>The C language allows you to add an integer between the percent sign (%) and the
letter in a format specifier. The integer is called the minimum field width specifier
because it specifies the minimum field width and ensures that the output reaches
the minimum width. For example, in %10f, 10 is a minimum field width specifier that
ensures that the output is at least 10 character spaces wide.</P>
<P>The example in Listing 5.6 shows how to use the minimum field width specifier.</P>

	In Listing 5.6, two integer variables, num1 and num2, are declared in line 6, and
	assigned 12 and 12345, respectively, in lines 8 and 9.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Without using any minimum field width specifiers, lines 10 and 11 print out the
two integers by calling the printf() function. You can see in the output section
that the output made by the statements in line 10 is 12, which takes two character
spaces, while the output, 12345, from line 11 takes five character spaces.</P>
<P>In line 12, a minimum field width, 5, is specified by %5d. The output from line
12 therefore takes five character spaces, with three blank spaces plus two character
spaces of 12. (See the third output line in the output section.)</P>
<P>The %05d in printf(), shown in line 13, indicates that the minimum field width
is 5, and zeros are used to pad the spaces. Therefore, you see the output made by

<P>The %2d in line 14 sets the minimum field width to 2, but you still see the full-size
output of 12345 from line 14. This means that when the minimum field width is shorter
than the width of the output, the latter is taken, and the output is still printed
in full.</P>
<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 12"></A>Aligning Output</H4>
<P>As you might have noticed in the previous section, all output is right-justified.
In other words, by default, all output is placed on the right edge of the field,
as long as the field width is longer than the width of the output.</P>
<P>You can change this and force output to be left-justified. To do so, you need
to prefix the minimum field specifier with the minus sign (-). For example, %-12d
specifies the minimum field width as 12, and justifies the output from the left edge
of the field.</P>

	The program in Listing 5.8 declares one integer variable, int_num, in line 6, and
	one floating-point number, flt_num, in line 7. Lines 9 and 10 assign 123 and 123.456789
	to int_num and flt_num, respectively.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In line 11, the default integer format is specified for the integer variable,
int_num, while the statement in line 12 specifies the integer format with a precision
specifier that indicates that the maximum field width is 8 characters long. Therefore,
you see that five zeros are padded prior to the integer 123 in the second line of
the output.</P>

<P>For the floating-point variable, flt_num, line 13 prints out the floating-point
value in the default format, and line 14 reduces the decimal places to two by putting
the precision specifier .2 within the format specifier %-10.2f. Note here that the
left-justification is also specified by the minus sign (-) in the floating-point
format specifier.</P>
<P>The floating-point number 123.46 in the fourth line of the output is produced
by the statement in line 14 with the precision specifier for two decimal places.
Therefore, 123.456789 rounded to two decimal places becomes 123.46.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 15"></A>Q&amp;A</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><B>Q</B> What are stdin, stdout, and stderr?</P>
	<P><B>A</B> In C, a file is treated as a series of bytes that is called file stream.
	stdin, stdout, and stderr are all pre-opened file streams. stdin is the standard
	input for reading; stdout is the standard output for writing; stderr is the standard
	error for outputting error messages.</P>

	<P><B>Q</B> How much is the hex number 32?</P>

	<P><B>A</B> Hexadecimal, or hex for short, is a base-16 numerical system. Therefore,
	32 (hex) is equal to 3*16<SUP>1</SUP>+2*16<SUP>0</SUP>, or 50 in decimal.</P>
	<P><B>Q</B> Are getc(stdin) and getchar() equivalent?</P>
	<P><B>A</B> Because the getchar() function reads from the file stream stdin by default,
	getc(stdin) and getchar() are equivalent.</P>
	<P><B>Q</B> In the function printf(&quot;The integer %d is the same as the hex %x&quot;,
	12, 12), what is the relationship between the format specifiers and the expressions?</P>
	<P><B>A</B> The two format specifiers, %d and %x, specify the formats of numeric
	values contained in the expression section. Here the first numeric value of 12 is
	going to be printed out in integer format, while the second 12 (in the expression
	section) will be displayed in the hex format. Generally speaking, the number of format
	specifiers in the format section should match the number of expressions in the expression
	section.</P>
