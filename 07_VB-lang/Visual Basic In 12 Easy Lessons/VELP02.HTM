<P>This lesson discussed the controls and properties of Visual Basic programs. The properties determine the look and behavior of the controls. The controls let the user interact with the program. When you write Visual 
Basic programs, you should follow as 
many standards as you can so that you can minimize any subsequent maintenance. You saw that the AUTOLOAD.MAK file determines how new projects will behave. You also learned

<BR>

<UL>

<LI>To use good judgment when you 
design applications so that you do not use several controls that would only make the application look too busy.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI>To use standard three-letter abbreviations when you name controls so that you know from its name exactly what kind of control 
you are working with.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI>To follow Windows programming standards so that your application looks and behaves like other Windows applications. That way, the user will be familiar with your programs and will be more likely to learn and use the 
programs that you write.

<BR>

<BR>

</UL>

<P>The projects at the end of each lesson in this book show the creation of a Visual Basic program. They demonstrate the concepts taught in each unit. You have only scratched the surface so far. Beginning with 
the next lesson, you will start learning the 
details of controls and properties. So far, you have seen only how to place and activate the label and command button controls. There is much more to learn about these and the other controls. For this project, 
focus on following the instructions to gain 
more insight and practice in using Visual Basic.

<P>Figure P2.1 shows the first screen of the application described in this project. The application is simple and easy to implement if you follow the instructions that come next.

<P><B> <A HREF="p2vel01.gif">Figure P2.1. Getting ready to view 
different </B><B>properties.</A></B>

<BR>

<P>The purpose of this program is to show you the various properties that are possible for labels. Lesson 3 explores the label control's properties in detail, but you are already versed enough in Visual Basic to 
understand the properties demonstrated by 
this program.

<BR>

<P>The program first displays a label in the 
center of the screen. The label's border shows that the label is wide. The text in the center of the label is small, and the label's background color is white. Click the Next Property command to see a different 
set of properties.

<BR>

<P>The property 
changed by your first command button click is the alignment. A label can be left-justified, centered, or right-justified inside its placed width. The label began as a centered label, but you now see a left-justified label.

<BR>

<P>Click Next Property 
again. The label takes on the right-justified alignment property.

<BR>

<P>Clicking the Next Property button once more returns the label to the centered alignment and changes the property's font size to a big font. As you click the Next Property button, 
you will see that the label updates to show you the changed property.

<BR>

<P>To see the label's background color change, click Next Property again. The background of the label turns bright green. (Wear your sunglasses.)

<BR>

<P>Click the Next Property 
command button once more to see the final label property change. As Figure P2.2 shows, the width of the label shrinks to a smaller size. When you click the Next Property command button again, the label returns to its original 
size, font, and color 
property values.

<NOTE><A NAME="I2"></A><B>Note: </B>This project's application contains a command button 
event procedure that changes all the properties whenever the user clicks the Next Property command button. This project does not list the code for that event procedure 
because the code would make absolutely no sense at this point in the book. If you 
really want to see the code, scroll through the Code window after you start the program.</NOTE>

<P>You can now exit the program by clicking the Exit command button. The application quits running, and you will return to the Visual Basic development environment.
