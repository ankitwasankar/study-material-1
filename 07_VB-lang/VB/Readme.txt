(Shareware Version)

Course Description:

Beginning Visual Basic introduces the world of computer programming by providing an interactive, self-paced tutorial to the Visual Basic programming language and environment.  The approach to a Visual Basic application are explained in step-by-step, simple, easy-to-follow terms.  Ten plain-English lessons explain the toolbox, event procedures, and many elements of the BASIC computer language.  Numerous examples are used to demonstrate every step in the application building process. The tutorial also includes several computer projects for you to build and try.  These projects illustrate practical applications of Visual Basic, including loan calculators, graphics programs, and even a simple video game!

Beginning Visual Basic is presented using a combination of over 350 pages of course notes (written in Microsoft Word format) and many Visual Basic examples and projects.


Course Prerequisites:

To use Beginning Visual Basic, you should be comfortable working within the Windows environment, knowing how to find files, move windows, resize windows, etc.  No programming experience is needed.  You will also need the ability to view and print documents saved in Microsoft Word format.  This can be accomplished in one of two ways.  The first, and easiest, is that you already have Microsoft Word (or a compatible equivalent) on your computer.  The second way is that you can download the Microsoft Word Viewer.  This is a free Microsoft product that allows viewing and printing Word documents - it is available for download at all the major shareware internet sites (ZDNet, Download.Com, SoftSeek).

Finally, and most obvious, you need to have Microsoft Visual Basic. Visual Basic is a separate product that must be purchased if you do not have it.  This course is generic for the most part.  The tutorial can be completed using any edition (Learning, Standard, Professional, Enterprise) of Visual Basic 4.0 (32 bit version), Visual Basic 5.0, or the newest Visual Basic 6.0.  Older versions of Visual Basic can be purchased at low prices from used software stores and on-line auction sites.  The newer versions can be purchased at software stores (in your area or on-line) and at auction sites.  If you are a student, try finding academic versions.



Installing Beginning Visual Basic:

The course notes and code for the shareware version of Beginning Visual Basic are included in one single ZIP file.  Use your favorite 'unzipping' application to write all files to your computer.  The course is included in the folder entitled BeginVB.  This folder contains two other folders:  BVBNotes and BVBProjects.

The BVBNotes folder includes all the notes needed for the class.  Each file in this folder has a DOC extension and is in Microsoft Word.  The files are:

StartHere.doc	This file in Word format
Contents.doc	Course Table of Contents
Class1.doc	Class 1. Introducing Visual Basic
Class2.doc	Class 2. The Visual Basic Environment
Class3.doc	Class 3. Your First Visual Basic Project
Class4.doc	Class 4. Project Design, Forms, Command Buttons
Class5.doc	Class 5. Labels, Text Boxes, Variables
Class6.doc*	Class 6. Scroll Bars, Decisions, Random Numbers
Class7.doc*	Class 7. Icons, Frames, Check Boxes, Option Buttons
Class8.doc*	Class 8. Picture Boxes, Mouse Events
Class9.doc*	Class 9. Game Design, Lines, Shapes, Images
Class10.doc*	Class 10. Timers, Keyboard Events
Appendix.doc*	Appendix. Other Projects to Try

(Files marked with a * are not included with the shareware version).  The BVBProjects folder includes all the Visual Basic projects developed during the course.  This folder has three other folders:  VB4Projects, VB5Projects, and VB6Projects.  Use the one corresponding to your version of Visual Basic.



How To Take the Course:

Beginning Visual Basic is a self-paced course.  The suggested approach is to do one class a week for ten weeks.  Each week's class should require about 3 to 6 hours of your time to grasp the concepts completely.  Prior to doing a particular week's work, open the class notes file for that week and print it out.  Then, work through the notes at your own pace.  Try to do each example as it is encountered in the notes.  Work through the projects in Classes 3 through 10.  If you need any help, all completed projects are included in the BVBCode folder.
