<H2><A NAME="HeadingAA"></A>Introduction</H2>
<P>THIS BOOK IS NOT ONLY FOR beginning programmers who want to learn Visual Basic
but also experienced programmers who are familiar with other programming languages
and seek a working knowledge of Visual Basic. Every page of <I>Using Visual Basic
6</I> provides you with useful facts and techniques. The aim is to teach you how
to program by showing you programs--sometimes step by step and sometimes with a conceptual,
from-the-ground-up point of view.</P>
<P>The author of this book assumes that you have a working knowledge of Windows,
that you've done word processing or used a spreadsheet, and that you know your way
around the Windows interface. It's also assumed that you have a copy of Visual Basic
6, access to a computer, and time to review the topics and work with the examples
in each chapter. Very, very rarely can someone read a book on computer programming
and instantly &quot;get it&quot; without taking the time for some hands-on experience.</P>
<P>Learning a programming language is a challenging experience. The author and technical
reviewers of this book are professional programmers who have made every effort to
convey the fun and challenge of VB programming while addressing your need for relevant,
easy-to-understand material. If Visual Basic programming is something that you want
to do, either professionally or as a side activity, and you need a book that instructs
in a clear, concise, real-world manner, this is for you.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Heading1"></A>Why This Book?</H2>
<P>Have you ever purchased a <I>Using</I> book from Que? For many years, the <I>Using</I>
books have proven invaluable to readers as both learning guides and references. The
<I>Using</I> series is an industry leader and has become practically an industry
standard. We encourage and receive feedback from readers all the time, using their
suggestions whenever possible.</P>
<P>This book isn't a compiled authority on all the features of Visual Basic. It's
a streamlined, conversational approach to productive, efficient programming in Visual
Basic. Features of this book include</P>

<UL>
	<LI><I>Relevant information written just for you.</I> We have carefully scrutinized
	which features and tasks to include in this book and have chosen those that apply
	to your everyday use of Visual Basic. Why invest in material that teaches you how
	to perform tasks you might never need to perform?
	<P>
	<LI><I>Reference or tutorial.</I> You can learn to quickly perform a task by using
	the step-by-step instructions, or you can investigate the why and wherefore of a
	task in the discussions preceding each task.
	<P>
	<LI><I>Wise investment.</I> We don't waste your valuable bookshelf space with redundant
	or irrelevant material, nor do we assume that you know it all or need to know it
	all. Here is what you need, when you need it, and how you need it--with an appropriate
	price tag.
	<P>
	<LI><I>Easy-to-find procedures.</I> Every numbered step-by-step procedure in the
	book has a short title explaining exactly what it does. This saves you time by making
	it easier to find the exact steps necessary for accomplishing a task.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Heading2"></A>How to Use This Book</H2>
<P>You can use this book in various ways:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><I>If you are a beginning programmer,</I> the best way to go about using this
	book is to read each chapter in sequence. Some chapters build on knowledge shared
	in previous chapters. If you skip around, you might be confused because you missed
	a concept or technique introduced in other areas of the book.
	<P>
	<LI><I>If you are an experienced programmer,</I> skipping around might be the better
	way to go. If you have mastered some of the conceptual items--such as variables,
	arrays, loops, and conditional statements--reading chapters at random would make
	the best use of your time. The book is designed so that each chapter can more or
	less stand on its own.
</UL>

<P>Each page of the book contains the main text and margin notes. These margin notes
are helpful when you're looking for brief snippets of information. The book is also
full of figures, code listings, and tables that you will find useful now and in months
to come as you refer to this book in your day-to-day programming activity.</P>
<P>More than 20 working programs are associated with this book. You can download
these from the book's Web site at http://www.mcp.com/info. When you locate the URL,
you'll be asked to enter the book's ISBN: Enter 078971633x and then click the <B>Search</B>
button to go to the <B>Book Info</B> page. You'll find references and listings that
relate to the code throughout the book. Feel free to use the code in your own programming
activities.</P>
<P>

	shows you how to use the new ADO data control. This chapter also explains data designers,
	data providers, data consumers, and SQL.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Heading9"></A>Conventions Used in This Book</H2>
<P>The following items are some of the features that make this book easier for you
to explore:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><I>Cross-references.</I> We've looked for all the tasks and topics related to
	a topic at hand and referenced them for you. If you need to look for coverage that
	leads up to what you're working on, or you want to build on the new skill you just
	mastered, these references direct you to the appropriate sections in the book:
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI><I>Glossary terms.</I> For all terms that appear in the glossary, you'll find
	the first appearance of that term <I>italicized</I> in the text.
	<P>
	<LI><I>Boldfacing.</I> You can easily find the onscreen menu and dialog commands
	by looking for boldfaced text, as in the following example: From the <B>File</B>
	menu, choose <B>Save</B>.
	<P>
	<LI><I>Sidenotes.</I> Information related to the task at hand or inside information
	from the authors is offset in SideNotes--to avoid interrupting the flow of the text
	and to make it easy for you to spot valuable information. Each SideNote has a short
	title to help you quickly identify the information you'll find there.
</UL>

<P>Visual Basic's syntax for commands, scripts, and SQL statements also incorporates
special elements. Look at the following syntax example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>For <I>CounterVar</I> = <I>StartNum</I> To <I>EndNum</I> [Step <I>StepNum</I>]
     <I>statements</I>
Next [<I>CounterVar</I>]
</PRE>

<UL>
	<LI>Terms that are <I>italicized</I> are placeholders. When you use one of these
	terms in real life, you replace the italicized word with an appropriate value. For
	example, <I>StartNum</I> in the preceding code would be replaced with an actual number
	from which the loop starts.
	<P>
	<LI>Brackets ([]) in command syntax indicate optional clauses. The brackets around
	[Step <I>StepNum</I>] in the preceding code indicate that you aren't required to
	provide the Step keyword or what size step the increment/decrement should be. When
	you use the command, don't include the brackets.
	<P>
	<LI>A | character indicates that you choose between one item or the other, not both.
	Again, don't use this character in the actual command.
	<P>
	<LI>An ellipsis (...) in listings indicates a clause that can repeat or skipped code
	that's not pertinent to the discussion. Don't use the ellipsis in the actual code.
</UL>

<P>Most code listings include line numbers to make discussion about the code easier
to reference. Don't include the numbers with any real-life Visual Basic code.</P>
