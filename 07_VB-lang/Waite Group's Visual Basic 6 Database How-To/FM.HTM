<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Introduction</H1>
<H2><A NAME="Heading1"></A>About This Book</H2>
<P>Since version 3, Visual Basic has been the tool of choice for database programmers
everywhere. First came DAO with version 3, RDO with version 4, and then the ability
to build robust ActiveX components in version 5. With each successive version, Microsoft
adds more functionality to make database programming easier for you.</P>
<P>Visual Basic's powerful database feature set has continued to grow with version
6. New tools and technologies like ADO, OLE-DB, and the Microsoft Data Reporter vie
for your attention. What does it all mean, what can it do for you, and most importantly,
how do you quickly get up to speed?</P>
<P>That's why this book was created. <I>Visual Basic 6 Database How-To</I> gives
an in-depth view of each major method of data access, with real-life examples with
which to work. Like all books in the successful How-To series, <I>Visual Basic 6
Database How-To</I> emphasizes a step-by-step problem-solving approach to Visual
Basic programming. Each How-To follows a consistent format that guides you through
the issues and techniques involved in solving a specific problem. Each section contains
the steps to solve a problem, as well as a discussion of how and why the solution
works. In most cases, you can simply copy the provided code or objects into your
application and be up and running immediately. All the code described in the book
is available on the accompanying CD-ROM.</P>
<P>The book's concepts and examples are useful to Visual Basic programmers of all
skill levels. Each How-To is graded by complexity level, with information on additional
uses and enhancements to fit your needs exactly. Additionally, each chapter contains
an introduction that summarizes each How-To and covers the chapter's techniques and
topics so that you can zero in on just the solution you need without having to go
through hundreds of pages to find it.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Heading2"></A>What You Need to Use This Book</H2>
<P>You need Visual Basic 6, Professional or Enterprise Edition. This book was written
using Visual Basic 6 Enterprise Edition, but most sections will work with the Professional
Edition. Many of the sections will also work with Visual Basic 5, but specific references
to menu selections and windows may have changed between versions. You may have to
improvise the How-To's to make the samples work with Visual Basic 5.</P>
<P>Most chapters avoid using controls or tools not included with Visual Basic 6,
Professional or Enterprise Edition. However, much of Visual Basic's strength is its
extensibility using third-party tools and controls. You are encouraged to explore
third-party offerings; they can often cut significant time from the development cycle.</P>

<P>I want to thank my wife Judy for again putting up with the grumpy foul beast who
possesses me when I don't get enough sleep. I would also like to thank the Clinical
and Clinical beta teams at Visteon who had to put up with that same beast.</P>

<P>I would like to thank everybody at Macmillan who was gracious enough to give me
another opportunity to do what I love, write. I would especially like to thank Brian
Gill, Ron Gallagher, and Chris Nelson. I would also like to thank my other half,
Kimberly, for putting up with many nights of not seeing me so that I could work to
finish projects such as this book. I love you so very much, and I cannot wait to
spend the rest of my life with you.</P>

<P>I want to extend my thanks to the kind folks at Macmillan Computer Publishing

atmosphere in which to work. Rory, a brother in arms, &quot;You know what I mean,
man!&quot; Mom, Dad, Michael, and Peter, for your eternal support for every step
I take. Steven and Dawn for providing a great get away from the woes of computerdom.
