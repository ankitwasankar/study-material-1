(Shareware Version)

© KIDware (206) 721-2556



Course Description:

Learn Visual Basic 6.0 is a 10 week, self-paced overview of the Visual Basic programming language and environment.  Upon completion of the course, you will:

Understand the benefits of using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 as an application development tool. 
Understand the Visual Basic event-driven programming concepts, terminology, and available tools.
Learn the fundamentals of designing, implementing, and distributing a wide variety of Visual Basic applications.

Learn Visual Basic 6.0 is presented using a combination of course notes (written in Microsoft Word format) and over 60 Visual Basic examples and applications.


Course Prerequisites:

To grasp the concepts presented in Learn Visual Basic 6.0, you should possess a working knowledge of Windows 95 and have had some exposure to programming concepts.  If you have never programmed a computer before, you'll have to put in a little more effort - perhaps, find a book in your local library on programming using QBasic or some other dialect of the Basic computer language.

You will also need the ability to view and print documents saved in Microsoft Word format.  This can be accomplished in one of two ways.  The first, and easiest, is that you already have Microsoft Word on your computer.  The second way, and a bit more difficult, is that you can download the Microsoft Word Viewer.  This is a free Microsoft product that allows viewing Word documents - it is available for download at all the major shareware internet sites (ZDNet, Download.Com, SoftSeek).

Finally, and most obvious, you need to have Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, preferably the Professional Edition.  This is a separate product that must be purchased - check out on-line software stores and auction sites.  Learn Visual Basic 6.0 does not cover the rudiments of navigating in Visual Basic 6.0.  You should be familiar with the simple tasks of using the menus, the toolbar, resizing windows, and moving windows around.  Visual Basic 6.0 provides an excellent tutorial with instruction on such tasks.

Installing Learn Visual Basic 6.0:

The course notes and code for Learn Visual Basic 6.0 are included in one single ZIP file.  Use your favorite 'unzipping' application to write all files to your computer.  The course is included in the folder entitled LearnVB6.  This folder contains two other folders:  VB Notes and VB Code.

The VB Notes folder includes all the notes needed for the class.  Each file in this folder has a DOC extension and is in Word for Windows 95 format.  The files are:

Start Here.doc	This file in Word format
Contents.doc	Course Table of Contents
Class 1.doc	Class 1. Introduction to the Visual Basic Language and Environment
Class 2.doc	Class 2. The Visual Basic Language
Class 3.doc	Class 3. Exploring the Visual Basic Toolbox
Class 4.doc	Class 4. More Exploration of the Visual Basic Toolbox
Class 5.doc*	Class 5. Creating a Stand-Alone Visual Basic Application
Class 6.doc*	Class 6. Error-Handling, Debugging and File Input/Output
Class 7.doc*	Class 7. Graphics Techniques with Visual Basic
Class 8.doc*	Class 8. Database Access and Management
Class 9.doc*	Class 9. Dynamic Link Libraries and the Windows API
Class 10.doc*	Class 10. Other Visual Basic Topics
Appendix I.doc	Appendix I. Visual Basic Symbolic Constants
Appendix II.doc	Appendix II. Common Dialog Box Constants
Appendix III.doc	Appendix III. DAO Data Control

(Files marked with a * are not included in the shareware version.)  The VB Code folder includes all the Visual Basic applications developed during the course.  The applications are further divided into Class folders.


How To Take the Course:

Learn Visual Basic 6.0 is a self-paced course.  The suggested approach is to do one class a week for ten weeks.  Each week's class should require about 4 to 8 hours of your time to grasp the concepts completely.  Prior to doing a particular week's work, open the class notes file for that week and print it out.  Then, work through the notes at your own pace.  Try to do each example as they are encountered in the notes.  If you need any help, all solved examples are included in the VB Code folder.  After completing each week's notes, a homework exercise is given, covering many of the topics taught that week.  Like the examples, try to work through the homework exercise, or some variation thereof, on your own.  Refer to the completed project in the VB Code folder, if necessary.
