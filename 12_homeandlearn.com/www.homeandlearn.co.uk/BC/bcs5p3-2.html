        <h3>What is a Virus?</h3>
        <p>A computer virus is a programme, or piece of code, that is written 
          to interfere with, and harm, your machine. A virus can replicate itself, 
          spread to other computers, and attack other programmes on your computer. 
          (By attack, we mean change or delete files.) Computer experts distinguish 
          between a virus, a worm, and a Trojan. Here's the differences:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <Div class ="leftMargin"><b>Virus</b> - Can replicate and spread to other 
          computers. Also attacks other programmes<br>
          <b>Worm</b> - A special type of virus that can replicate and spread, 
          but generally doesn't attack other programmes<br>
          <b>Trojan</b> - Doesn't replicate, but can spread. Doesn't attack other 
          programmes. Usually just a way of recording and reporting what you do 
          on your PC</div>
      </blockquote>
      <Div class ="leftMargin"> 
        <p>Viruses are split into different categories, depending on what they 
          do. Here are a few categories of viruses:</p>
        <p><b>Boot Sector Virus</b><br>
          The Boot Sector of a PC is a part of your computer that gets accessed 
          first when you turn it on. It tells Windows what to do and what to load. 
          It's like a &quot;Things To Do&quot; list. The Boot Sector is also known 
          as the Master Boot Record. A boot sector virus is designed to attack 
          this, causing your PC to refuse to start at all!</p>
        <p><b>File Virus</b><br>
          A file virus, as its name suggests, attacks files on your computer. 
          Also attacks entire programmes, though.</p>
        <p><b>Macro Virus</b><br>
          These types of virus are written specifically to infect Microsoft Office 
          documents (Word, Excel PowerPoint, etc.) A Word document can contain 
          a Macro Virus. You usually need to open a document in an Microsoft Office 
          application before the virus can do any harm.</p>
        <p><b>Multipartite Virus</b><br>
          A multipartite virus is designed to infect both the boot sector and 
          files on your computer</p>
        <p><b>Polymorphic Virus</b><br>
          This type of virus alter their own code when they infect another computer. 
          They do this to try and avoid detection by anti-virus programmes.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/vr2-2.jpg"></p>
        <h3>How do Viruses get on my computer?<a name="HowDo"></a></h3>
        <p>The most common way that a virus gets on your computer is by an email 
          attachment. If you open the attachment, and your anti-virus programme 
          doesn't detect it, then that is enough to infect your computer. Some 
          people go so far as NOT opening attachments at all, but simply deleting 
          the entire message as soon as it comes in. While this approach will 
          greatly reduce your chances of becoming infected, it may offend those 
          relatives of yours who have just sent you the latest pictures of little 
          Johnny! </p>
        <p>You can also get viruses by downloading programmes from the internet. 
          That great piece of freeware you spotted from an obscure site may not 
          be so great after all. It could well be infecting your PC as the main 
          programme is installing. And if you or your children download software 
          from peer to peer networks (like Kazaa, Morpheus, Shareaza) then you 
          could be downloading more than you bargained for!</p>
        <p>If your PC is running any version of Windows, and it hasn't got all 
          the latest patches and updates, then your computer will be attacked 
          a few minutes after going on the internet! (Non Windows users can go 
          into smug mode!)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/vr3-2.jpg"></p>
        <h3>Could I be infected by a Virus?<a name="Could"></a></h3>
        <p>If you are infected by a virus, your computer may exhibit some well-known 
          symptoms. Here's a few signs that you may be infected:</p>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin"> Your computer starts running more slowly than 
            it usually does</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Your computer keep crashing</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Your computer keep crashing and then restarting</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Programmes you normally work with suddenly 
            start behaving oddly</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Div class ="leftMargin">You can't access your disk drives</div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <Div class ="leftMargin">
        <p>Other symptoms to look out for are strange error messages, documents 
          not printing correctly, and distorted menus and dialogue boxes. Try 
          not to panic if your computer is exhibiting one or two items on the 
          list. </p>
        <p>The first thing to do is to scan your PC with your (up-to-date) anti 
          virus software. If your anti-virus software fails to detect anything, 
          then that doesn't mean you're NOT infected - it may just be poor anti-virus 
          software. And remember, most popular doesn't mean most effective. While 
          Norton and Mcafee are good, extensive tests in respected computer magazine 
          show that they are not the best. Not being the best means that they 
          may fail to detect the virus on your PC! Not only that, Norton and Mcafee 
          are becoming really expensive to maintain!</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Free Anti-Virus software<a name="Which"></a></h3>

        <p>There are some good free anti-virus solutions out there. The most popular 
          is AVG. This has gotten results that are as good as the market leaders. 
          You can check it out here (this page also tells you what you DON'T get 
          with the free edition):</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="http://www.grisoft.com/doc/products-avg-anti-virus-free-edition/lng/us/tpl/tpl01" target="_blank">AVG 
          Free Edition</a></p>
        <p>Once installed, AVG will update itself on a regular, daily basis. It 
          will also scan emails for viruses, and alert you if it finds anything. 
          The interface is a bit old-fashioned but, hey, it's free and it does 
          a quite a good job!</p>
        <p>Another good solution is AntiVir from Avira. The classic edition is 
          free, as well. Check out their website here:</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank">Avira 
          AntiVir Personal Edition Classic</a></p>
        <p>AntiVir will also protect users of non Microsoft computers (Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris). 
          It is, of course, debatable whether you need anti-virus protection if 
          you don't have a Windows machine!</p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you're changing AV software, you MUST make sure that 
          the old one has been completely uninstalled first. Norton and Mcafee 
          can be difficult to uninstall, and you should consult their website 
          BEFORE uninstalling - they may even have a special tool to do the job. 
          Some people have said that trying to uninstall Norton or Mcafee was 
          worse than getting a virus. (If you see an ad below for either of these 
          two - it's not because we chose it!)</p>
