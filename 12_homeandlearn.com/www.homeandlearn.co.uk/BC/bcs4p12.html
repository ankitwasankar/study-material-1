        <p>This tutorial assumes that you have set the Control panel to Classic 
          View. To see how to do this, click this link (opens in a new window):

        <p><b>Windows XP comes with its own rudimentary security centre</b>. This 
          consists of a Firewall, and settings for Automatic Updates. It also 
          tells you if you have anti virus software enabled.</p>
        <p align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--

</script></p>
        <p>To get at the Security Center (note the American spelling, for you 
          Brits!), click the <b>Start</b> button in the bottom left of your screen. 
          From the Start menu, click <b>Control Panel</b>. You should see an item 
          for <b>Security Center</b>. Double click this to bring up the following 
          screen:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security.jpg" width="383" height="272" border="1" alt="Windows XP Security Centre"></p>
        <p>If you can't see the Security Center icon in your Control Panel, then 
          you need to update your version of Windows XP. The Security Center was 
          part of Service Pack 2. Click <b>Start &gt; All Programs,</b> and look 
          for the <b>Windows Update</b> item at the top of the menu. Or go to 
          the following internet address:</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a></p>
        <p>The page should (if you're using Internet Explorer) detect if you need 
          to update your version of XP.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Windows XP Firewall</h3>
        <p>A software firewall is a programme that sits between you and the rest 
          of the world, when you're on the internet. A good firewall will detect 
          if anyone is trying to get at your PC, and automatically block the attempt. 
          Firewalls like the free Zonealarm will even alert you if anything on 
          your computer is trying to contact the outside world. It will then ask 
          your permission for this programme to go ahead. You can, typically, 
          click on a <b>Block</b> or <b>Allow</b> button.</p>
        <p>Windows XP came with a firewall. But until Service Pack 2, this was 
          turned off by default. When Microsoft updated the XP operating system, 
          it revamped the firewall, and turned it on by default.</p>
        <p>The Firewall option in the Security Centre tells you straight away 
          of it is on or off. Click the down arrows to see more options:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security2.jpg" width="460" height="102" alt="Firewall Settings"></p>
        <p>If you have a separate firewall on your PC, you might see this instead:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security3.jpg" width="460" height="141" alt="More Firewall Settings"></p>
        <p>As the message says, having two or more firewalls on the PC can be 
          a hindrance rather than a help. If you have something like Zonealarm, 
          or Norton Internet Security, then you won't need the Windows XP Firewall. 
          These programmes will even turn off the XP firewall for you.</p>
        <p>If you're only relying on the Windows XP firewall, however, there is 
          an obvious danger: if Zonealarm and Norton Internet Security can switch 
          off the XP firewall behind your back, so can things like viruses, worms 
          and Trojans. It's recommended that your get a separate software firewall 
          for your pc. </p>
        <p>But to see the settings for the XP firewall, click the icon under &quot;Manage 
          Security Settings For&quot;:<br>
        </p>
        <div align="center"><img src="images2/security4.jpg" width="335" height="109" border="1" alt="Manage Security Settings"> 
        </div>
        <p>When you click the Windows Firewall option, you'll see the following 
          screen:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security5.jpg" width="350" height="415" alt="Windows Firewall Options"></p>
        <p>We'll get on to Exceptions in a moment, but the only things you need 
          to do on this screen is make your choice: On, or Off? Click OK to get 
          back to the Security Center screen. You'll then see the Firewall section 
          reflect your changes.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--

        <h3>Firewall Exceptions</h3>
        <p>An exception, in firewall terms, is a programme or service that you 
          would like to access your PC, and don't want your firewall blocking. 
          Click the Exceptions tab at the top to see the following screen:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security6.jpg" width="350" height="415" alt="Windows Firewall Exceptions"></p>
        <p>In the list box, you see the programmes and service that are allowed. 
          Here, we're only allowing three. Two of them are for AVG anti Virus, 
          and the other is the Windows XP service <b>File and Printer Sharing</b>. 
          Check your list to see if anything suspicious is on it. You should be 
          wary if Remote Assistance and/or Remote Desktop are ticked. These are 
          XP services that allow other people (PC technicians, for example) to 
          control your computer. If you haven't allowed say the man form Dell 
          to tinker with your PC over the phone, then you should ask why these 
          are ticked. Remote Desktop is useful if you're away from home and want 
          to access your PC. There is even software that allows you to do just 
          that. If you have such software, it would explain why Remote Desktop 
          is ticked. Check which programmes you have that might explain why these 
          are ticked.</p>
        <p>If you have a version of XP other than XP Home Edition then there are 
          separate settings for the Remote Desktop. In can be really handy if 
          you're away on holiday and want to check your email! Some even hook 
          up a few web cams so that they can keep an eye on things remotely. If 
          you're interested in a free online service that allows you to do all 
          this, then pop along to <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/products/pro/">https://secure.logmein.com/products/pro/</a> 
          for more information. </p>
        <p>You can add a programme to the list of exceptions by clicking the button. 
          When you do, you'll see a list of programmes. Select the one you want 
          to allow (or click Browse), and then click OK.</p>
        <p>If you're trying to get your computer to play an online game, then 
          you may need to allow traffic on a certain port. The makers of the game 
          will tell you which port number you need, and any other settings. Once 
          you have these, click the Add Port button and enter the details.</p>
        <p>If you click the Advanced tab at the top of the dialogue box, you'll 
          see a list of network connections for which the XP firewall is enabled.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Automatic Updates</h3>
        <p>Windows XP is prone to security attacks, as everybody knows. Microsoft 
          try to keep on top of things by releasing updates to the operating system. 
          If you have Automatic Updates turned on, then you don't need to do anything 
          else: XP will connect to the internet, and check if any updates are 
          available. If so, they will automatically be downloaded and installed. 
        </p>
        <p>If , in the security center, Automatic Updates says &quot;Check security 
          settings&quot;, then you haven't got it turned fully on. Click the link 
          for Automatic Updates, under &quot;Manage security settings for&quot;, 
          to see the following settings:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security7.jpg" width="329" height="363" alt="Automatic Updates"></p>
        <p>In the image above, we specified that XP should notify us if there 
          are any updates available, but it won't download them or install then 
          unless we say so. It's recommended thatselect the first option, though 
          - Automatic. You definitely don't want it on the last option - Turn 
          off Automatic Updates!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Virus Protection</h3>
        <p>Another setting under Security Center is the Virus Protection. Click 
          the down arrows to see more information:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/security8.jpg" width="481" height="115" alt="Virus Protection Settings"></p>
        <p>XP is telling us that we have AVG Anti-Virus, and that it is up to 
          date. If you have less well know anti virus protection then it may not 
          show up here, and Virus Protection may give you a false reading. As 
          long as your Anti-Virus is running, then you don't need to worry about 
          this.</p>
        <p>Security Center is a good addition to Windows XP, and if you don't 
          have it in your Control Panel, you defintely need to update your computer 
          - you could be, and probably are, at risk!</p>
