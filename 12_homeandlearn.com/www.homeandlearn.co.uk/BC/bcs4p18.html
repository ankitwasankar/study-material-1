        <p>For this tutorial, you'll need the Internet Options dialogue box. To

        <p>Another tab on the Internet Options dialogue box is <b>Privacy</b>. 
          This allows you to choose your Cookie settings, and whether to allow 
          popup windows. The Privacy tab looks like this:</p>

          to know what Cookies are.</p>

        <h3 align="left">What is a Cookie?</h3>
        <p>A Cookie is a small text file that a website places on your computer. 
          It does this because web pages are not good at remembering things. If 
          you select an option a form, and then go to another page on the same 
          site, the next page won't know what you selected on the previous one. 
          This is important if you do any online shopping, for example. If you 
          order two things on two different pages, and then click the &quot;Check 
          Out&quot; button on the second page, only one of them will be remembered 
          - the one on the same page as the &quot;Check Out&quot; button. </p>
        <p>So that your choices can be remembered, a text file is placed on your 
          PC - a Cookie. This, in most cases, is just a record of what you selected 
          on a previous page. If you navigate to the following folder on your 
          hard drive, you'll be able to see the Cookies on your own computer:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><b>C:\Documents and Settings\user\Cookies</b></p>
        <p>Because they are only text files, you can double click to open them. 
          Here's what a Cookie looks like:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsPrivacy2.jpg" width="375" height="148" alt="A Cookie opened up in Notepad"></p>
        <p align="left">As you can see, this one is from the BBC website. The 
          numbers won't mean anything except to the website which placed the information 
          on the computer. But it could be anything: the 1024 above, for example, 
          may be the width of your computer screen. You'd then be served up a 
          page that suits your screen size. But it could very well mean the 24th 
          day of the 10th month. This would then be the date that the Cookie is 
          deleted from your PC!</p>
        <p>A reputable site will have a Cookie policy telling you why they use 
          them, and what they do with any information stored. (We don't use Cookies 
          at all, in case you're wondering!)</p>
        <p>The fuss about Cookies is that the website doesn't ask you - it just 
          goes ahead and places itself on your PC. This raised quite a few security 
          scares because people didn't know exactly what these things did. Plus, 
          a Cookie can be used to store personal information about you that a 
          web site gathers when you visit it. If you're worried about Cookies, 
          then you can change the settings from the Internet Options <b>Privacy</b> 
          tab. In our first image, we had the slider at the top - this will block 
          all Cookies from the computer. If a web site we trusted, and needed 
          to use, was asking to place a Cookie on the PC, then we could easily 
          put the slider down to low. </p>
        <p>If you click the <b>Advanced</b> button just below the Cookie slider, 
          you see more option:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsPrivacy3.jpg" width="378" height="302" alt="Advanced Cookie Settings"></p>
        <p align="left">If you place a tick in the box &quot;Override automatic 
          cookie handling&quot; then the rest of the options become available. 
        </p>
        <p>A first-party Cookie is one that comes from the website you're visiting. 
          A third-party Cookie is one that comes from somewhere else. This could 
          be from an advertising banner on the page, for example, which will then 
          dump its own information onto your PC. </p>
        <p>A session is the time you spend on the internet with one browser window 
          open. When you close the browser down, the session will end. If you 
          have a tick in the box &quot;Always allow session cookies&quot;, then 
          any Cookie that a website placed on your computer will be deleted when 
          the session ends.</p>
        <p>The settings in the image above, incidentally, are not a recommendation 
          for you to select the same options. In fact, we'd recommend that you 
          uncheck the box &quot;Override automatic cookie handling&quot;, and 
          then set your slider to Block all Cookies. If a web site you know and 
          like is complaining that you need to enable Cookies in your browser, 
          then simply move your slider back down.</p>

        <h3>Block Popup windows </h3>
        <p>Also on the Privacy tab is an area for pop up windows. Most of these 
          are just annoying adverts that you close down straight away. But a few 
          can be malicious, launching harmful scripts in the background, or trying 
          to get Spyware onto your PC. If you want to block all pop up windows, 
          put a tick in the box:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsPrivacy4.jpg" width="367" height="87" border="1" alt="Pop-up Blocker"></p>
        <p align="left">When a tick is in the &quot;Block pop-ups&quot; box, the 
          Settings button becomes available. Click the button to see the following:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsPrivacy5.jpg" width="425" height="351" border="1" alt="Pop-up settings"></p>
        <p align="left">If you prevent all pop ups then things like a banking 
          site, which may launch in a separate window, won't be available. You 
          can add a site you trust to the list of Allowed sites. Just type the 
          address in the first text box, and click the Add button.</p>
        <p>In the &quot;Notifications and Filter Level area&quot;, you'll notice 
          a tick box that says &quot;Show Information Bar when a pop-up is blocked&quot;. 
          The Information Bar looks like this:<br>
        </p>
        <div align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsPrivacy6.jpg" width="395" height="50" border="1" alt="The Information Bar"> 
        </div>
        <p align="left">So Internet Explorer tells us that the Pop-up was blocked. 
          Click the icon to see the additional options:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsPrivacy8.jpg" width="228" height="83" alt="Turn off the pop-up blocker in Internet Explorer"></p>
        <p align="left">If you want to turn off the pop-up blocker, then select 
          Settings from the menu above. You will get another menu allowing you 
          to turn it off.</p>
