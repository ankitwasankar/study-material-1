		<p>Online banking is quite a handy way to keep track of your finances. 
          You simply log on through your bank's website, and you can do things 
          like set up standing orders, transfer money to people or other accounts, 
          and order cheque books. Online banking also allows you to get financial 
          deals that are just not on offer in the offline world. For convenience 
          sake, you can't beat an online bank!</p>
        <p>However, this popularity of online banking has not gone unnoticed by 
          the criminal fraternity. We'll show you some popular attacks on your 
          money, and what you can do to prevent them.</p>
        <h3><br>
          Phishing<a name="phishing"></a></h3>
        <p>One of the most common ways that a criminal will attempt to part you 
          with your money is through something known as Phishing. Phishing is 
          pronounced FISH-ING. It's the Internet's equivalent of this popular 
          sport. The fisherman is a criminal, the bait is usually an email that 
          attempts to panic you into action, and the fish is you!</p>
        <p>The criminal will send out thousands of email using a list he got from 
          a spammer. The email that is sent pretends to be from a bank. Let's 
          call it the Wee Bank. Most people the criminal sends the email to will 
          not have an account with the Wee Bank. But some will. It's those few 
          that he's after. In the email, you may be warned that your banking details 
          need updating, and that it's essential that you act now to protect your 
          account. They'll usually try to scare you into taking action. And there's 
          always a link for you to click on. All you need to do is to click on 
          the link and you'll be taken to a secure area where you can enter your 
          details.</p>
        <p>If you click on any of these links, you'll be taken to a page that 
          does indeed look like your bank's website. Except it's not. One trick 
          the criminal may use is to have an address that looks similar to your 
          bank's. Your real bank is this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/weeBank2.gif" width="143" height="28" alt="Real Address" border="1"></p>
        <p>Take a closer look at the address bar, though, and you may see something 
          like this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/weeBank.gif" width="148" height="26" alt="Spoofed Address" border="1"></p>
        <p>The address has been spoofed. The &quot;w&quot; is now &quot;vv&quot; 
          - two V's and not one W. But some spoofed addresses are quite difficult 
          to spot, and even fool the more experienced surfers. You need to look 
          for other clues in your browser.</p>
        <p>One thing that all browsers will have are padlock icons. These are 
          supposed to tell you that the site is using security measures. If you're 
          using Internet Explorer 7, you'll see this to the right of the address 
          bar:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/weeBank3.gif" width="421" height="58" border="1"></p>
        <p>Click on the padlock and you'll see information about the security 
          certificate (the one in the image below is for 2checkout - a genuine 
          source):</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/certificates2.gif" width="280" height="223" alt="Internet Explorer 7 Security"></p>
        <p>Click the link that says View Certificates, and you'll see something 
          like this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/certificate.gif" width="409" height="483" alt="View Certificates"></p>
        <p>Click the <b>Details</b> and <b>Certification Path</b> tabs at the 
          top. There should be plenty of details for you to view. Make sure the 
          certificate has not expired. In the image above, the security certificate 
          is from a good source, and it's still valid (at least, it was when this 
          article was written).</p>
        <p>The Firefox browser has more visual clues than Internet Explorer. Notice 
          the address bar from Firefox:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/firefoxYellow.gif" width="520" height="60" border="1"></p>
        <p>The address bar will turn yellow on a secure site, and the padlock 
          is just to the left of the blue down arrow. Firefox also has another 
          padlock. Look in the bottom left and you'll see this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/firefoxPad.gif" width="140" height="150" border="1"></p>
        <p>Double click the padlocks and you'll see the security certificate. 
          Notice the name of the website to the left of the padlock. This one 
          is from a legitimate source - 2checkout.com</p>
        <p>One more thing to note. The address for a secure site normally starts 
          with https. If the &quot;s&quot; is missing, it's not a secure site!</p>
        <p>A last word of warning, however: these visual clues have been know 
          to be spoofed by the criminals! If in doubt, remember this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>You bank will <u>NEVER</u> send you an email asking 
          for your login details!</b> </p>
        <p>If you receive such an email, forward it to your bank. And DON'T click 
          on the link!</p>
        <p>The same is true for other secure websites that hold your money - PayPal 
          never send you emails asking you to confirm your details! For a more 
          detailed look at Phishing, there's an excellent Wikipedia article here:</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" target="_blank">Phishing 
          Article</a></p>
        <p>The latest versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer have anti-Phishing 
          measures built in. You should make sure these are turned on when accessing 
          secure websites. (In Internet Explorer 7, click <b>Tools &gt; Phishing 
          Filter &gt; Check this Website</b>.)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Password Protection<a name="protect"></a></h3>
        <p>We've all got passwords. In fact we've all got LOTS of passwords! We've 
          got so many that it's become increasingly difficult to keep track of 
          them all. Banking passwords are no different. But the recommendation 
          is to keep changing each one every few months or so! </p>
        <p>Because the whole password process is cumbersome, some people have 
          one password for all of the sites on the internet that ask for them. 
          This is something you should NEVER do! You need a different password 
          for each site. The reason is simple - if a criminal has your password 
          for one website, he's got them for all your sites - he could clean you 
          out!</p>
        <p>The problem is, how do you remember them all? One technique for password 
          creation is to take letters and numbers from a favourite song, saying, 
          or something that's special to you. For example, a favourite song of 
          yours may be &quot;happy birthday to you&quot;! To turn this into a 
          password, take the initial letters of each word. You'd then have this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>hbty</b></p>
        <p>Not very secure, but easy to remember. Let's complicate it a bit, by 
          adding some capitals:</p>
        <p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000">HB</font>ty</b></p>
        <p>Slightly more secure. Let's add a number:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>HB<font color="#FF0000">2</font>y</b></p>
        <p>Getting better. How about a non alpha-numeric character?</p>
        <p align="center"><b>HB<font color="#FF0000">_</font>2y</b></p>
        <p>Adding non alpha-numeric character helps password security enormously. 
          Let's make the password longer by singing Happy Birthday to Home and 
          Learn:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>HB_2y_HBdhAL</b></p>
        <p>Now, not only is the password longer, but it has a mix of numbers, 
          lowercase and uppercase letters, and non alpha-numeric character. This 
          makes it more secure, and harder for criminals to guess. (The password 
          is now &quot;Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Home and Learn&quot;.) 
          A password like this is also easier for you to remember.</p>
        <p>Passwords should never be just four characters long! The reason is 
          that criminals may have password-cracking software. Using such software, 
          short passwords can be cracked in no time at all. Use at least 8 characters. 
          Duke University have a good page here that tells you how long it would 
          take to crack a password of up to 8 characters. The amount of time needed 
          to crack a password rises dramatically:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>You and Your PC<a name="yourpc"></a></h3>
        <p>You should never log in to your bank account using somebody else's 
          computer. Simply because you have no idea what security measures they 
          take, and whether or not the computer is infected. </p>
        <p>Internet cafes are also not somewhere you should be entering security 
          information. In an internet cafe, all the data you enter is logged and 
          saved by the owners (they may be forced to do this by law). You can 
          never be sure that your data is safe from prying eyes. Also, what if 
          you forget to log out properly? The next person who uses the computer 
          could see all of your details, and have access to your bank account!</p>
        <p>The only place you should be entering your bank details are from your 
          own PC. Of course, you need to make sure that your own computer is safe 
          from infection, and take sensible security measures when it comes to 
          the emails you receive. Follow the suggesting on our site and your PC 
          will be just that much more secure than it was yesterday!<br>
