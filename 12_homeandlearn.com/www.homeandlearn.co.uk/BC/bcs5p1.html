        <h3>What is Spyware?</h3>
        <p>Broadly speaking, Spyware is something that sneaks on to your computer, 
          usually with the intentions of extracting money from you. At its worst, 
          Spyware can take control of your computer, directing you to web pages 
          you didn't want to go to, downloading other nasty stuff in the background, 
          and even harvesting email address, passwords and your credit card details. 
          But even a mild case of Spyware infection can be nuisance. </p>
        <p>If you've ever been plagued by annoying pop-ups when your computer 
          loads, or have strange new icons where your clock is (bottom right, called 
          the System Tray), or if you're directed to a strange webpage when you 
          try to go on to the internet, then you may well be infected.</p>
        <p>Spyware, in the main, gathers information about you and your online 
          habits, and sends that information to third party. And all without asking 
          for your permission! </p>
        <h3><br>
          Where does Spyware come from?<a name="Where"></a></h3>
        <p>Spyware can come from a whole host of different sources. But Spyware 
          mainly gets on to your PC through deception. For example, suppose you 
          receive this email:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images3/spyware.gif" width="522" height="233" alt="Email with potential Spyware" border="1"> 
        </p>
        <p align="left">You'd assume that this email was sent to you in error. 
          Can you resist clicking on the link? After all, what harm can it do? 
          Well, a lot actually! There well may be a joke on the site, but there's 
          something less funny going on in the background - the web page is trying 
          to sneak something on to your PC! You may also have seen a harmless-looking 
          popup window asking you to click a button to proceed. You'll click it 
          anyway, just to get rid of it. Clicking OK is what's infected your PC!</p>
        <p>Other sources of Spyware infection are freeware or shareware software, 
          an operating system that is un-patched and hasn't got the latest security 
          software, downloading stuff from peer-to peer applications - the list 
          is long!</p>
        <p>And don't think your Anti-Virus software will protect you - it won't! 
          Spyware is not considered to be a virus, so your Anti-Virus software 
          won't spring in to action once an infection takes place - it will stay 
          sleeping in the background, unaware that anything malicious is going 
          on. The best tool for the job is a dedicated Spyware Detection system. 
        </p>
        <p align="center"> <img src="icons/s2.jpg" width="75" height="75"><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Beware of the Scam Merchants! <a name="Beware"></a></h3>
        <p>You may have come across a website that promises to check your PC for 
          Spyware infection. All for free. All you need to do is to click a button 
          to scan your PC. So you download, scan, and lo and behold - it's found 
          something! Then up pops a message directing you to a website that lets 
          you buy the software.</p>
        <p>Except, it didn't really detect anything. Or if it did, it's what's 
          know as a false positive (Something that sounds dangerous but isn't). 
          The job of the scan is to scare you into buying their software. </p>
        <p>If you type in &quot;Spyware detection&quot; into Google, most of the 
          results that come back are for these types of programmes. According 
          to <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Spyware/?p=727" target="_blank">Suzi 
          Turner</a>, writing on <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Spyware/?p=727" target="_blank">Zdnet</a> 
          , some of the most popular Spyware scams are these products:</p>
        <OL>
          <LI><b>SpyAxe</b></LI>
          <LI><b>SpySheriff</b></LI>
          <LI><b>PSGuard</b></LI>
          <LI><b>WorldAntiSpy</b></LI>
          <LI><b>Spy Trooper</b></LI>
          <LI><b>Razespyware</b></LI>
          <LI><b>SpywareNo or SpyDemolisher</b></LI>
          <LI><b>WinAntiVirus or WinAntiSpyware 2005</b></LI>
          <LI><b>SlimShield tied with &quot;Winhound Spyware Remover&quot;</b></LI>
          <LI><b>Spyware Bomber (shut down by the FTC)</b></LI>
		  </OL>
        <p>Hopefully, you haven't bought anything on the top ten list! Even if 
          you haven't, check out the alarmingly long list of scam Spyware on <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm" target="_blank">spywarewarrior.com</a> 
          (Fortunately, they also have a good-software list!)</p>
        <p>If you've bought any of the software on the bad list then the protection 
          you have is at no protection at all. At worst, these pieces of software 
          can be incredibly difficult to get rid of - Spyware themselves! </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/s3.jpg"></p>
        <h3>How to get Rid of Spyware<a name="FightingBack"></a></h3>
        <p>As a computer owner, you really need your wits about you in the Spyware 
          detection game. So what are you to do if you can't even trust the very 
          people who say they are going to help you clean your PC? Well, you can 
          fight back! The best way to do that is with software from very reputable 
          companies. The following are the most well-known (and free) anti-spyware 
          solutions:</p>
        <UL>
          <LI><a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/download_and_buy/product_comparison_chart.php" target="_blank">Ad-Aware 
            (SE Personal Edition)</a></LI>
          <LI><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html" target="_blank">SpyBot 
            Search and Destroy</a></LI>
          <LI><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft 
            Windows Defender</a></LI>
        </UL>
        <p>Ad-Aware is probably the easiest to use of the three. SpyBot is good, 
          but a bit complex for beginners. Microsoft Windows Defender 
          is well worth getting, too. However, it's not the easiest piece of software 
          in the world to use. You do get some good tools with it, though. Check 
          out the websites by clicking the links above (there's a tutorial on 
          the Microsoft site for Windows Defender).</p>
        <p>Once you download your chosen anti-spyware solution, you need to install 
          it on to your PC. After you have installed it, start the software and 
          do a full scan of your computer. (Ad-Aware has a nice big button that 
          says &quot;Scan&quot;!)</p>
        <p>Unlike anti-virus software, it IS recommended that you have more than 
          one anti-spyware solution on your PC. This is because spyware can be 
          very difficult to get rid of, and anti-spyware software will rarely 
          find 100 percent of threats. By having more than one solution, what 
          one piece of anti-spyware programme misses, the other should (hopefully) 
          pick it up.</p>
