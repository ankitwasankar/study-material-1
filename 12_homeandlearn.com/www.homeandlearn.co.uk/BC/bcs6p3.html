        <h3>What is a Router?</h3>
        <p>A standard modem allows you to connect one computer to the internet 
          at a time. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="wireless/pcModemWeb.jpg" alt="Single Computer Internet Connection"></p>
        <div align="center"></div>
        <p>A router allows you to connect one or more computers at a time:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="wireless/pcsRouterWeb.jpg" width="171" height="150" alt="Multiple Computers Connected to the Internet"></p>
        <p>It's called a router for the simple reason that signals are being routed 
          back and forth. The computers can be connected to the router either 
          with a wire (called an Ethernet Cable), or without wires. We're interested 
          in a Wireless Router. Here's a picture of one:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="wireless/wireless_router.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Linksys Wirless Router"></p>
        <p>This model is a Linksys, one of the big players in the wireless game. 
          Other big players are Belkin, D-Link and Netgear. Notice the two anetennas 
          sticking out. Most wireless routers have at least one. The antennas 
          can be unscrewed and replaced by something bigger and more powerful. 
          Data from the internet will travel through the router and then those 
          antennas. They are then broadcast to the <a href="bcs6p2.html">Wireless 
          Adaptor</a> on your computer or laptop. (And any other wireless adaptor 
          in range - whether it's yours or not! See the security section below 
          for how to solve this)</p>
		  		        <p align ="center"> 

          <script type="text/javascript" src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Wireless Jargon</h3>
        <p>There's a lot of jargon associated with the wireless router you buy. 
          In the previous section, we discussed what 802.11g was. The 802.11 is 
          a common standard that helps devices talk to each other. The g is an 
          improvement to the 802.11 standard. However, as of September 14th 2009, 
          a new standard has finally been ratified, seven years after it was first 
          put forward! The new standard is 802.11n. This newer standard offers 
          faster and more reliable wireless signals. You have been able to get 
          Draft N routers for some time now. But the ratification of the treaty 
          by manufacturers means that a wireless adaptor bought from one company 
          should work with another's routers, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Another bit of jargon you'll see is MIMO. This stands for Multiple-Input 
          Multiple-Output. Which does, of course, tell you nothing! But MIMO is 
          a technology aimed at giving you a better range for your wireless signals, 
          and can carry more data in those signals (throughput). But you need 
          a wireless adaptor that supports the MIMO technology, if you buy a wireless 
          router with the words MIMO on it.</p>
        <p>If you have a 3G connection, look out for MiFi. This is a way to share 
          computers using a 3G connection, rather than a fixed line ADSL connection, 
          or cable broadband. With a MiFi router you insert your SIM card into, 
          and this connects to the internet, rather than your USB dongle. The 
          router should then let you connect several computers to the Internet 
          at once using wireless, ethernet, or both.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What's involved in setting up a Wireless ADSL Router?</h3>
        <p>Manufacturers like Linksys are making it easier to set up wireless 
          routers. Look for an Installation CD, or a Quick setup option. At the 
          very least, there should be some instructions to follow along with. 
          If you have an ADSL broadband connection, then you'll want to buy a 
          wireless router with a ADSL modem built in. (It will say this on the 
          box.) The model below, for example, is Linksys WAG200G - Wireless-G 
          ADSL Home Gateway:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="wireless/WAG200G_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Linksys WAG200G - Wireless-G ADSL Home Gateway"></p>
        <p>The ADSL in the product name means it has an in-built ADSL modem. In 
          other words, you won't need the modem that your Internet Service Provider 
          gave you. If you look at the image below, you'll see a socket for Line 
          (the white one). You plug your phone cable (called and RJ11) in to this 
          socket. At the moment, you probably have this cable plugged in to a 
          USB modem that you got from your internet provider:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="wireless/linksysBack.jpg" width="452" height="81" alt="Ports on a Wireless Router"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The four yellow sockets are for ethernet cables, allowing you to connect 
          up to four computers with a wired connection (as well as the wireless 
          computers). But the wireless router above comes with a User Guide and 
          Setup Wizard on CD-ROM, and it will explain all this as you're setting 
          it up.</p>
        <p>The first step is usually to set up your router with a direct cable 
          connection. (Called an Ethernet or Network cable. This is usually supplied 
          with the router). The wizard should then take you through a few steps 
          to get you connected to the router, and on to the Internet. Before you 
          do this, you should contact your ISP and get any router setting they 
          may have. You'll also need your broadband username and password.</p>
        <p>But once you have a wired connection set up, you can then set up a 
          wireless connection. When you have your wireless connection up and running, 
          you can then unplug the Network cable.</p>
        <p>Look out for all those lights on your router. You'll see the following 
          lights on the Linksys WAG200G - Wireless-G ADSL router above:</p>
        <p><b>Power</b> Turns Green when you plug the power cable in</p>
        <p><b>Wireless</b> Turns green if you get a successful wireless connection. 
          Flashes green if data is being transferred from the wireless adaptor 
          on your computer</p>
        <p><b>Ethernet</b> Turns green if the supplied Network cable is plugged 
          in correctly to the router and computer. Starts flashing green when 
          data is being transferred</p>
        <p><b>DSL</b> This is the ADSL light. It starts flashing green if it can't 
          get a connection from your phone sockets. If it stays solid then your 
          ADSL connection is OK</p>
        <p><b>Internet</b> Tells you whether the connection to your Internet Service 
          Provider is OK. Will be solid green if everything is OK. This light 
          will be red if the connection fails (if there's outage at your ISPs 
          end, for example.)</p>

        <h3>What's involved in setting up a Wireless Cable Router?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have an ADSL connection, but have a cable broadband connection, 
          then don't buy an ADSL wireless router. You want one that you can plug 
          your modem in to. Look for any wireless router that DOESN'T have the 
          words ADSL in the title.</p>
        <p>The modem you got from your ISP will probably be connected to your 
          computer via an ethernet cable. Unfortunately, you can't just plug this 
          in to your shiny new wireless router and expect it to work! When you 
          plug your Ethernet cable in to your computer, you're plugging it in 
          to an ethernet card. Your ethernet card has a unique address called 
          a MAC address. Cable providers connect you via the MAC address of your 
          ethernet card. Your new router will have a different MAC address. So 
          if you plug your ethernet cable in to this, your provider won't know 
          where you are, and you won't get any web pages!</p>
        <p>The good news is that there's something called MAC address spoofing. 
          This is when the router pretends to be your ethernet card. If you get 
          a wireless router like the <a href="bcs6p8.html">Buffalo AirStation 
          G54 High Power</a> then the install process will take care of this for 
          you. The process will be fairly painless. The bad news is that some 
          routers expect you to do all this for yourself! The manual will then 
          explain how to get the MAC address of your ethernet card, and how to 
          enter this information in to the router. The wireless cable routers 
          we've chosen on our recommended pages all have easy setup options for 
          MAC address spoofing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If something goes wrong, then you may need to gain access to what's 
          called the Configuration pages.</p>
        <h3>
          <!-- google_ad_section_end -->
        </h3>
        <h3>What are Router Configuration Pages?</h3>
        <p>Each router will have what's called Configuration pages. You access 
          these through a browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox. These don't 
          come from the Internet, though, so you don't need an active broadband 
          connection to see them. In the configuration pages, you can do things 
          like set your broadband username and password, set up wireless security, 
          set up online gaming, see the current status of your connection, and 
          a whole lot more besides.</p>
        <p>To get in to the configuration pages, you need to be connected to your 
          router. This can either be with the Network cable, or via your wireless 
          adaptor. Start up your browser, and enter the address for your router. 
          These differ, but for the Linksys router it will be:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>http://192.168.1.1</b></p>
        <p>You will then be asked for a username and password. Routers will have 
          a default for both of these. For the Linksys, it's admin for the username 
          and admin for the password. (Look in your manual for the router's address 
          and default username and password.) Click OK and you'll be in to your 
          configuration pages. </p>
        <p>If you can't see any configuration pages then the connection from your 
          computer to the router is not working. So don't blame your ISP! Time 
          to pour over those manuals! </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Wireless Security</h3>
        <p>Another thing you may need to do in the config pages is to set up wireless 
          security. If you don't have security switched on, anyone within range 
          of your wireless router will be able to connect to it. There are two 
          forms of security that most wireless routers use, WEP and WPA. What 
          you are doing here is encrypting your signals with a key. With wireless 
          security turned on, the router needs your key before it will allow any 
          traffic through it. No key means no access.</p>
        <p><b>WEP</b><br>
          Wired Equivalent Privacy. This is an older form of security and is not 
          as safe as WPA. There are programmes around that hackers can download 
          to crack WEP. Once they have WEP cracking software, they may be able 
          to gain access to your router and get a free ride on the Internet At 
          the very least! </p>
        <p>The WEP key, though, will be either 64 bits or 128 bits in length. 
          (128 bits is 26 characters, and will be mixture of the numbers 0 to 
          9 and the letters A to F.) If you have a Livebox from Orange, for example, 
          then it comes with WEP security. When setting up the router for a wireless 
          connection, you have type out all 26 characters. Get one wrong and it 
          won't connect!</p>
        <p><b>WPA</b><br>
          Wi-Fi Protected Access. WPA security is really an update to WEP. It 
          uses different and stronger encryption, and so is harder to crack. It's 
          easier for you to set up, as well, because you just need to set up a 
          short pass phrase instead of typing out 26 letters and numbers! You 
          should use WPA and not WEP</p>
        <p>A lot of wireless routers don't have security turned on by default. 
          Your configuration pages will allow you to turn it on, and there is 
          usually a help menu which explain the various security settings.</p>
