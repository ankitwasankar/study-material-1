</span>NVQ stands for National Vocational Qualification. It is available to people 
  in the UK, and is one of the few qualifications that employers have heard of. 
  If you want to work with computers, and live in the UK, becoming NVQ certified 
  is quite a good route to take. These certificates used to have a bad reputation, 
  and were held in such low regard that the letters NVQ were disparagingly nicknamed 
  Not Very Qualified. Not any more, though. The course material for all NVQs were 
  radically overhauled a few years ago, to great success. Doing an NVQ in any 
  subject these days involves quite a lot of studying. </P>
<p>An NVQ in Information Technology is split in to two different categories: User, 
  and Practitioner. </p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent2">Practioner</span></b><span class="TextIndent2">: 
  Installing software, maintaining computers, Desktop support, technical role</span><br>
  <b><span class="TextIndent2">User</span></b><span class="TextIndent2">: Using 
  software packages in an office environment</span></p>
<p>There are three NVQ levels to aim for, whichever category you study for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> NVQ Level One in Information Technology - User</h3>
<p>You need 40 points to pass the NVQ level one in Information Technology. There's 
  a mandatory unit worth 15 points, and the other 25 points can be made up from 
  about 15 optional units. The most popular optional units are word processing 
  (10 points), spreadsheets (10 points) and databases (10 points). Other popular 
  optional units are: email (5 points), internet (5 points), internet security 
  (5 points).</p>
<p>Although the NVQ level one is fairly basic, and shouldn't take you too long 
  to complete, it can be quite rewarding if you know very little about computers. 
  Here's a study list:</p>
<p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>Mandatory Units</b></span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Make selective use of IT (15 points)</span></p>
<p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>Optional Units</b></span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Operate a computer (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; IT trouble-shooting for users (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; IT maintenance for users (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; IT security for users (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Internet and intranets (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Email (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Word processing software (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Spreadsheet software (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Database software (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Website software (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Artwork and imaging software (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Presentation software (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Evaluate the impact of IT (5 points)</span></p>
<p>The idea is that you do the mandatory unit, and take you pick from the optional 
  ones. But the total has to add up to at least 40 points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NVQ Level Two in Information Technology - User</h3>
<p>The subjects for level two are pretty much the same as for level one. The difference 
  is how much you need to learn before you qualify. In level one, you only needed 
  40 points to pass; in level two, you need 100. Again, there's a mandatory unit 
  (worth 25 points now), and about 15 optional ones. The optional units will be 
  worth 20 and 15 points each. You need a more in-depth knowledge to pass level 
  two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NVQ Level Three in Information Technology - User</h3>
<p>If you pass level three it equates to about A Level, which is the pre-university 
  qualification in the UK for 16 and 17 year olds. You need 180 points to get 
  your level three NVQ. The mandatory unit is now worth 35 points, while optional 
  units are 35 and 30. The studying for level three is far more intense, and you'll 
  be quite the expert when you're done! A lot of universities are taking on IT 
  students who have passed NVQ level 3.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">NVQ Levels One to Three in Information Technology - Practioner</h3>
<p>The points on offer for the Practioner NVQ qualifications in IT are the same 
  as for User above. So for level one, you need 40 points to pass. The subjects 
  are different, though. To get an idea of whether this is for you, here's a few 
  of the popular ones:</p>
<p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>Mandatory Units (you need both of these)</b></span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Develop personal and organisational effectiveness 
  (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Health and safety in ICT and contact centres 
  (5 points)</span></p>
<p><br>
  <b><span class="TextIndent2">Optional Units</span></b><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Customer Care (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Software installation and upgrade (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; System operation (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Technical advice and guidance (5 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Technical fault diagnosis (10 points)</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">&gt; Working with ICT hardware and equipment (10 points)</span></p>
<p>As you work your way through each NVQ level, the studying gets harder. Achieve 
  level three and you could gain work in an help desk environment, with a decent 
  entry-level salary. If you want to move on to higher qualifications in a support 
  or networking role, gaining a NVQ level three qualification is an excellent 
  place to start.</p>
