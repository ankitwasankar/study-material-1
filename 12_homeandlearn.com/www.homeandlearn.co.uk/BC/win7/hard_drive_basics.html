        <h1>Hard Drive Basics </h1>
        The Hard Drive on your computer is where all your files are stored. Not 
        only that, it's the place where the Operating System itself is installed. 
        A hard drive is a physical thing inside of your computer. If you were 
        to take it apart, you'd see one of more disks (called platters), one on 
        top of the other. In a modern hard drive, however, there's usually just 
        one platter. The disks are magnetised and can be written to and read from. 
        The writing and reading is done by an arm which moves across as the disk 
        is spun round. If you were buying a new hard drive, you'd see a figure 
        like <b>7,200 rpm</b> (revolutions per minute) or <b>10, 000 rpm</b>. 
        This refers to the speed at which the disks spin. The higher the spin 
        speed the faster the hard disk will be.

        </p>
        <p align="left">Not all hard drives use the spinning disk and arm approach, 
          however. A modern laptop or Netbook may use something called a <b>Solid 
          State Drive</b> (SSD). These have no moving parts, and are considered 
          faster than a hard drive. However, the space available on a SSD is a 
          lot less than on a hard disk, but this could change over the next few 
          years or so. At the moment, SSDs are lot more expensive than hard drives. 
          But again, this could change.</p>
        <p align="left">Whichever drive you have, hard or Solid State, just bear 
          in mind that a drive is a physical thing that you use to store files, 
          install programmes and Operating Systems.<br>
          The size of a hard drive does not refer to its height or width but to 
          how many Gigabytes of data can be stored on it. If you're wondering 
          how big a Gigabyte is then think of a single byte as holding, say, one 
          letter of the alphabet. A kilobyte can then hold a thousand letters 
          (actually, 1024 letters as there's just over a thousand bytes in a kilobyte). 
          A Megabyte could hold 1, 000, 000 letters (1, 048, 576 bytes), and a 
          Gigabyte 1000, 000, 000 letters (1 073, 741, 824)! </p>
        <p align="left">But those numbers are fairly meaningless in modern-day 
          computing. Think of how big a picture is that you take on a camera phone. 
          A medium sized image will be about 250 kilobytes. So you could get four 
          if the memory held only a megabyte and about 4 000 if you had a Gigabyte 
          of memory on your phone.</p>
        <p align="left">You can check to see how big the hard drive is on your 
          own computer. To do that, start up Windows Explorer by clicking its 
          icon just to the right of the Start button:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/win_explorer_icon.gif" width="261" height="95" alt="Windows Explorer icon"></p>
        <p align="left">When Windows Explorer starts, you'll see this screen:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/win_explorer.gif" width="469" height="365" alt="Windows Explorer showing the Documents folder" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">The default location is inside of the <b>Libraries</b> 
          folder. Click the Computer section instead:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/win_explorer_2.gif" width="157" height="259" border="1" alt="The Computer item in the Navigation pane"></p>
        <p align="left">You'll then see this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/computer_area.gif" width="484" height="335" border="1" alt="A list of attached drives in Windows 7"></p>
        <p align="left">This area should display a graphic of how much space you 
          have left on your hard drive, and how big it is. In the image above, 
          this computer has a hard drive size of 465 Gigabytes (GB), and there 
          is still a roomy 410 Gigabytes of space free to use. The image also 
          shows other drives attached to the computer, a DVD writer in this case. 
          If you have a USB memory stick, it should show up here when it is inserted.</p>
        <p align="left">Note also that the drive has the name Local Drive (C:), 
          or just the <b>C Drive</b> for short. This C Drive is also known as 
          the <b>root drive</b>, as everything is stored on it. Think of it as 
          the master folder that holds all other folders and files inside of it.</p>
        <p align="left">Now click on the C drive to highlight it. You should see 
          some extra option become available at the top:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/computer_area_drive.gif" width="513" height="338" alt="The Properties button" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">The one we're interested in is the <b>Properties</b> option. 
          Click on this and you'll see a dialogue box appear. This one:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/disk_properties.gif" width="367" height="499" border="1" alt="The hard drive Properties tab"></p>
        <p align="left">Again, we see a graphic of how big the hard drive is, 
          and how much space is free. The graphic this time is a pie chart. </p>
        <p align="left">One thing to note here is that the size of the hard drive 
          is 465 Gigabytes, even though it was marketed as having a 500 gigabyte 
          hard drive. So why the discrepancy? It's because the manufactures uses 
          a small &quot;g&quot; for gigabytes, and they use 1 gigabyte to mean 
          a billion bytes. However, a true Gigabytes has a capital &quot;G&quot; 
          and means 1 073, 741, 824 bytes. So a 500 Gigabyte hard drive actually 
          has 35 GB missing!<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 align="left">Hard Disk Cleanup</h3>
        <p align="left">If your hard drive is showing a lot of used space, and 
          not much free space, then click the button &quot;Disk Cleanup&quot; 
          to see if you can rescue some space. You should then see a small dialogue 
          box like this one:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/disk_cleanup.gif" width="341" height="146" alt="Windows 7 calculating free space" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">When Windows has finished its calculation, you'll then 
          see this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/disk_cleanup_2.gif" width="378" height="470" border="1" alt="Disk Cleanup's calculated free space"></p>
        <p align="left">Disk Cleanup is telling us that it has found 90.0 Megabytes 
          of files that it can safely delete. These are the ones with check marks. 
          You can check any of the other boxes, as well. For example, the image 
          above shows that the Recycle Bin has 1.97 GB of files in it. If you're 
          sure you haven't accidentally sent an important file to the Recycle 
          Bin then you can safely delete these files as well. In which case, give 
          it a check mark by clicking inside of its box. The same applies to all 
          the others on the list (scroll down to see more). Click on an item to 
          see a description of just what each item on the list does.</p>
        <p align="left">You can also click the button at the bottom &quot;Clean 
          up system files&quot;. All this does is to add even more areas to the 
          list. But you need to delete the system files with care. If you're not 
          sure about an area, leave it unchecked.</p>
        <p align="left">When you're happy with your selections, click the OK button 
          to free up disk space. Windows will then go to work erasing the files 
          and documents you have selected. When it's done, it will return to the 
          Disk Cleanup screen:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/disk_cleanup_3.gif" width="356" height="463" border="1" alt="Space has been freed by Disk Cleanup in Windows 7"></p>
        <p align="left">In the image above, we're freed up 2 Gigabytes of space.</p>
        <p align="left">Another area worth exploring in the image above is <b>Tools</b>. 
          Click this tab at the top to see the following screen:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="hard_drive/tools_tab.gif" width="355" height="461" border="1" alt="Hard Disk tools in Windows 7"></p>
        <p align="left">You only need to click the <b>Error-checking</b> option 
          if you've been having a few problems with your computer. Otherwise, 
          you can leave it alone. The <b>Defragmentation</b> option is really 
          a matter of choice. If you have a big hard drive with lots of space, 
          there's little point in defragmenting. It's supposed to speed up file 
          access times, but is really only relevant on older hard drives that 
          don't have much free space. The <b>Backup</b> option is worth exploring. 
          When you click the button, Windows will search your computer for other 
          drives, like DVD writers. If it finds one, it will ask you to use that 
          to backup your files. More expensive versions of Windows 7 will have 
          better options for back up, like a network drive. You should always 
          back up your important files and documents, but cheaper versions of 
          Windows 7 are not that much help - you could easily copy your files 
          to a DVD yourself, without Window's help!</p>
