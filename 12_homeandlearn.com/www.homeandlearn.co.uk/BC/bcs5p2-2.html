        <h3>What is Spam?</h3>
        <p>It's a rare computer user who hasn't been bothered by Spam at some 
          stage. By Spam, we mean unsolicited emails that try to sell you things 
          of a dubious nature that you certainly didn't ask for and, in all probability, 
          don't need. Everybody hates spam. It can clog up your email box, threaten 
          the security of your PC, try to trick you into opening dangerous attachments, 
          and even render the mail box entirely unusable. Here at Home and Learn, 
          we've had to close down many email addresses due to spam. (We've only 
          ever met one person who liked spam. This was a pensioner, new to email, 
          who complained that something was blocking her advertisments. She wanted 
          to know how she could get them back!) </p>
        <h3><br>
          How do the spammers get hold of my email address?<a name="How"></a></h3>
        <p>Spam can come from a wide variety of sources, and the spammers have 
          many techniques to get hold of your email address. Here's just a few:</p>
        <p><b>&gt; From a web page</b><br>
          If you have ever posted to an online, public forum, and left your email 
          address on the page, then it will almost certainly end up in the hands 
          of the spammers. If you have your own website, and include your email 
          address in plain text, then that will also get stolen by the spammers. 
          In fact, anywhere on the web where you leave your email address is a 
          source for the spammers. If you can see it, so can they.</p>
        <p>The way they get the address is by something called harvesting. This 
          is done with a piece of software called a Spider. The sole job of the 
          Spider is to trawl through website looking for email addresses. Once 
          the spammer has enough addresses, he (they are usally &quot;he's&quot;) 
          can sell them to third parties, and other spammers.</p>
        <p><b>&gt; From an infected PC.</b><br>
          A lot of viruses these days contain code to trawl through your email 
          address book. These will then be sent to the spammer. If you have sent 
          an email to somebody who is infected, and that person has you in his/her 
          address book, then your address will be sent to the spammer.</p>
        <p><b>&gt; From YOUR infected PC</b><br>
          If you have a virus, the chances are that it will contain code to control 
          your email. It will then contact another computer and receive a list 
          of instructions, and email addresses. These instruction say something 
          like, &quot;Send the following email to this list of addresses&quot;. 
          Your PC won't be sending out thousands of emails, but just a few. This 
          is because your PC is just one of many thousand that are controlled 
          by the same spammer (called a botnet). If your computer sends out just, 
          say, 100 emails a day, then 100 times 1000 computers that the spammer 
          controls totals 100,000 emails a day. If the spammer controls 10,000 
          computers then that's a million emails a day he can send out!</p>
        <p><b>&gt; Trial and Error</b><br>
          if you have an email address based on your name, and if your name is 
          quite a common one, then the spammer will simply send out email trying 
          to guess the first part. For example, suppose the end of your email 
          address was &quot;smith.co.uk&quot; And you added &quot;John&quot; to 
          the start, your email address would be easy to guess, and you'd have 
          a very busy inbox indeed! If it was &quot;john12_KJ876@smith.co.uk&quot;, 
          it's unlikely the spammers could guess the first part.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/sp1-2.jpg" width="152" height="99"></p>
        <h3><br>
          Worst case scenarios<a name="Worst"></a></h3>
        <p>If your computer is infected, there could be another nasty side-effect 
          - YOU get banned! Because your computer has been indentifed as sending 
          out spam, you may well receive a message from your service provider 
          telling you that your account has been suspended. You then have to go 
          to the trouble of contacting your service provider, telling them that 
          you're not a spammer, and asking what to do to get off their &quot;bad 
          books&quot;.</p>
        <p>A more likely scenario is that your email gets bounced back to you 
          by someone like SpamCop. The email will identify your IP address, and 
          let you know that you're on a blacklist. SpamCop will keep you on the 
          blacklist until it receives no more spam from your IP address in a 24 
          hour period. (It may not be your IP address but the address of your email 
          servers. In which case, there's nothing you can do about it but notify 
          your service provider. Your service provider will then totally ignore 
          your call, and heap the blame on you!)</p>

        <h3><br>
          How to Defeat Spam<a name="Fight"></a></h3>
        <p>You can defeat spam (well, most of it). Here's a few ways.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Don't post your email address on a web page, unless you're disguising 
            it in some way. As an example, an email address in this format is 
            very difficult for a Spider to read, but quite easy for a human: </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="center"><b>firstBit @ co. uk. homeandlearn</b> (re-arange the 
          ending)</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Be wary of giving your email address to websites. Ask yourself, 
            is there a privacy statement anywhere on the site? (Ours is here <a href="../details-2.html" target="_blank">Privacy 
            Policy</a>) Can you easily opt-out if they send an email or newsletter 
            to you? Do you trust them? </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Never reply to a email sent to you by a spammer. If you do, you're 
            telling the spammer that the email address is live and active - the 
            very thing that he was looking for! (Remember: the spammer probably 
            bought his list off someone else, and has no idea whether an address 
            is active or not.)</LI>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Careful when opening attachments. Save the attachment to your hard-drive 
            first, scan with your (up-to-date) Anti Virus software, and only then 
            consider opening it. If you weren't expecting an email with an attachment, 
            it's safer to just delete the entire email!</LI>
        </ul>
		
		 
        <ul>
          <li>Set your email software to view message as text and NOT as HTML. 
            In Outlook Express you can do this by clicking <b>Tools &gt; Options</b> 
            from them menu bar. From the <b>Options</b> dialogue box, click the 
            <b>Read</b> tab. Put a tick in the box &quot;Read all messages in 
            plain text&quot;. The reason you'd want to do this is because HTML 
            emails can be very helpful to spammers. They insert an image that 
            tells them the email has been read, and thus that it's a live email 
            box. </LI>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider getting some Anti-Spam software. The best of these are 
            very good at detecing spam from the genuine emails. Here's two that 
            Computer Shopper recommended in a recent review. (Dec 2006) 
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.allume.com/win/spamcatcher/" target="_blank">Allume 
                SpamCatcher 4</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.cloudmark.com/homeoffice/" target="_blank">Cloudmark</a></li>
            </ul>
          </LI>
        </ul>
        <p>These both got 5 stars out of 5 in the review. The second one is only 
          for Outlook or Outlook Express users. (Mcafee anti-spam got 4 stars 
          out of 5, incidentally, and Norton only got 2!)<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A good free anti-spam solution is <a href="http://www.spampal.org/" target="_blank">SpamPal</a>. 
          This got 4 out of 5 stars, but Computer Shopper noted that it was a 
          bit &quot;clunky to set up&quot;. </p>
        <p align="left">But we recommend you start with the free software first, 
          and test it out. If it's not catching at least 90% of spam coming in, 
          then uninstall it and try something else!</p>
