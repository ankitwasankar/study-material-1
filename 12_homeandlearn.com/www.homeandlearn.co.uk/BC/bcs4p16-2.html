        <p>For this tutorial, you'll need the Internet Options dialogue box. To 
          see how to bring it up, click this page (opens in a new windows):</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>There are quite a few changes you can make on the <b>General Tab</b> of the 
          Internet Options dialogue box. First, you'll learn how to change your 
          Home Page. But if your browser is really crawling along, or odd things 
          are happening when surfing the internet, then you'll need to know how 
          to Delete Temporary Internet Files, how to Clear Cookies, and how to 
          make sure you get the latest version of a website. So bring up the Internet 
          Options dialogue box (see the link above for how to do this), and we'll 
          begin.</p>

        <h3>How to change your Home Page</h3>
        <p>When a browser like Internet Explorer is first started up, its default 
          behaviour is to go immediately to a web page. Which web page it tries 
          to go to is the one on the General tab of the Internet Options dialogue 
          box:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneralB-2.jpg" width="366" height="106" border="1" alt="How to change your Home Page"></p>
        <p>The area highlighted in blue, under <b>Home Page</b>, is the internet 
          site that you will be taken to when Internet Explorer first starts. 
          In the image, we've set it to go to <b>google.co.uk</b>.</p>
        <p>If you don't want Internet Explorer to go to any web pages at all when 
          it starts up, click the button Use Blank. (This is useful if you're 
          creating web pages, and just want to test them out.) Clicking the Use 
          Blank button will change the text box to this:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral2-2.jpg" width="363" height="105" border="1" alt="about.blank"></p>
        <p>If you see this in the Home Page text box then you should be looking 
          at a blank white page when Internet Explorer starts. However, there 
          is a notorious browser hijacker called <b>about.blank</b>. If, when 
          Internet Explorer starts, you see any pop up windows telling you about 
          Spyware and how to remove it then you've probably been infected. (Please 
          don't buy anything from these people!)</p>
        <p>If you are infected, then you may also notice a slow internet connection. 
          Other symptoms are search areas with &quot;Quick Web Search&quot;, &quot;Search 
          for &quot;, or &quot;Search The Web&quot;. What the creators of this 
          Spyware are trying to do is to re-route all your internet searches through 
          to their own paid listings, or serve you up lots of ads scaring you 
          into buying something. You may also get an unwanted toolbar in Internet 
          Explorer. To cure the problem, try this web site:</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="http://www.pchell.com/support/aboutblank.shtml">http://www.pchell.com/support/aboutblank.shtml</a></p>
        <p>But to change your Home Page to something else, do the following:</p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin"> Close down the Internet Options dialogue box 
            and navigate to the web site that you want explorer to go to when 
            it first opens</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Once you have the page open, click <b>Tools</b> 
            from the menu bar</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">From the Tools menu, select <b>Internet Options</b>:<br>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Div class ="leftMargin"> 
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral3-2.jpg" width="151" height="198" alt="From the Tools menu, select Internet Options"></p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin"> Once you see the Internet Options box, click 
            the button that says <b>Use Current</b>.</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Your text box should now display the address 
            of your chosen web site</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Click <b>OK</b></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Div class ="leftMargin">Close down Internet Explorer, and then open 
            it back up again. Do you see your chosen website? </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Div class ="leftMargin">
        <p>If you don't see your chosen web site, but some other page instead, 
          then there's a very strong possibility that your computer has become 
          infected with Spyware. See the internet page above for removal of Spyware 
          (scroll down until you see the links).<br>

        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>Clean up your Browser Files</h3>
        <p>When you surf the web, Internet Explorer stores a copy of your sites 
          in an area called <b>Temporary Internet Files</b>. It will also store 
          things like images and scripts. This is to speed up your web surfing. 
          If you're not on a fast broadband connection, this can be a real help. 
          If you don't clean out your Temporary Internet Files, however, they 
          can be a bit of a hindrance. As well as occupying lots of space on your 
          hard drive, some malicious web pages can cause you problems. </p>
        <p>To clean the folder, though, you need this area on the General tab 
          of the Internet Options dialogue box:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral4-2.jpg" width="362" height="96" border="1" alt="Click the Delete Files button"></p>
        <p>Click the button <b>Delete Files</b>, and you'll see this box:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral5-2.jpg" width="314" height="164" alt="Delete Temporary Internet Files"></p>
        <p>Put a tick in the box &quot;Delete all offline content&quot;, if you 
          want to really spring clean. Then click OK. If you have a lot of files 
          in the Temporary folder, then it may take a few minutes to complete 
          the deletion process. Make yourself a cup of coffee, and wait for XP 
          to finish!</p>
        <p>To see more Options, click the <b>Settings</b> button. You'll then 
          see this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral6-2.jpg" width="255" height="257" alt="Setting for Temporary Internet Files"></p>
        <p>You may think that you are getting the latest page from a site like 
          ours. But if you have <b>Never</b> selected under &quot;Check for newer 
          versions of stored pages&quot;, then you may be missing out. That's 
          because of something called <b>caching</b>. If a web site is on a server 
          in say the UK, and you're in the US, then the first time that you visit 
          the site, a copy will be held on a computer (server) near to you. The 
          copy is said to be held in a <b>cache</b>. The next time that you visit 
          the site, you may just get the copy (the cached version). Select the 
          option &quot;Every visit to the page&quot; to ensure that you're getting 
          the version from the original computer that the web site is held on 
          (at least, that's the theory).</p>
        <p>In the image above, you can also change how much of your hard disk 
          space that XP uses to store the Temporary Internet files. If yours is 
          really big, perhaps in the Gigabytes, then you'll definitely want to 
          change this. Move the slider to the left, to adjust the size downward. 
          In the image, we've gone for only 400 megabytes. But even this may be 
          too much for some!</p>
        <p>Clicking the button <b>View Files</b> will bring up the folder containing 
          all of the files and folders in Temporary Internet Files. </p>
        <p>If you've never deleted your Temporary Internet Files then there could 
          be quite a lot to see. (Hopefully, there won't be any nasty surprises 
          lurking there!)</p>
        <p>The <b>View Objects</b> button brings up a screen containing something 
          called Browser Helper Objects. Expect to see things like Flash, Java, 
          and Shockwave. These help Internet explorer to display things like animations 
          created for the Flash Player. Or even help to display Adobe Acrobat 
          PDF documents, Microsoft Word, and Excel files. But this folder can 
          also contain some very unhelpful Browser Helper Objects. If you've become 
          infected with Spyware it may place its own items here. The following 
          site is a free check for Internet Explorer issues. If you have any parasites 
          on your PC, it should find them:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><a href="http://www.doxdesk.com/parasite/" target="_blank"><b>http://www.doxdesk.com/parasite/</b></a></p>
        <p>The site will also give you information about the parasite, and removal 
          instructions. But it can't check for everything our there!<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Clear your Browsing and Address Bar History</h3>
        <p>You can clear the Address bar of website in the drop down list. This 
          usually appears when you start typing an web site address. Select an 
          address from the list to go to that page. However, if you have embarrassing 
          websites on the list, they are there for all to see. To clear your Address 
          bar list, click the button Clear History:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral7-2.jpg" width="364" height="100" border="1" alt="Clear your Browsing and Address Bar History"></p>
        <p>If you don't want any addresses appearing in the drop down list at 
          all, then set the value to 0 next to &quot;Days to keep pages in History&quot;.</p>
        <h3><br>
          Additional Buttons</h3>
        <p>Also on the General tab of the Internet Options dialogue box, you'll 
          see these buttons:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images2/inetOpsGeneral8-2.jpg" width="360" height="34" border="1" alt="Additional Buttons"></p>
        <p>The buttons allow you to change the colours of hyperlinks on a web 
          page from the usual blue to a colour of your choice. You can also set 
          which fonts and font sizes for all the text on web pages.</p>
        <p>In the next part, we'll take a look at the Security tab of the Internet 
          Options dialogue box.</p>
