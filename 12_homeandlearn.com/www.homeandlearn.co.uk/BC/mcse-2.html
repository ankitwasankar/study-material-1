<p>For those wanting a career in IT, Microsoft's Network certificates have been 
  a valued goal for a long time now. There are two main ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE)</li>
</ul>
<p> The final one, the MCSE, is probably the most well-know of the professional 
  IT qualifications. Type in <b>Jobs +MCSE</b> into Google and you get over a 
  million results. Which gives you some idea of how well-know it is. Gaining this 
  certificate can lead to a high paying job.</p>
<p>However, the MCSE has become somewhat devalued over the past few years. A while 
  ago, it used to be a career path that took 3 to 5 years worth of hard study. 
  Now, a lot of companies have sprung up offering Fast-Track MCSEs. Known as Boot 
  Camps, they offer to get your through the MCSE in about a month. Typically, 
  you fly off to a training centre in say India, pay about 3000 dollars, and cram 
  for 30 days. You still have to study, but there's often plenty of cheat-sheets 
  to help you pass the exams. </p>
<p>The problem is, there's so much knowledge required for a Systems Engineer job, 
  that you can't possible learn it all in a month. The MCSE certificate you get 
  through a Boot Camp may get you an interview, but you may get found out in the 
  technical questions stage.</p>
<p>Before paying any money for the MCSE, Microsoft recommends that you have a 
  least one years experience in a network environment of over 200 users. An by 
  experience, the don't mean just cleaning the mouse balls!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The MCSE - What's involved</h3>
<p>As a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, your job is to set up Microsoft 
  Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows Servers, and make sure everything is running 
  smoothly. In the jargon, it's design, manage and implement the server infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are seven exams to take and pass, six Core exams and one Elective. For 
  the Core exams, there's four networking ones, a client operating system exam, 
  and a design exam. Here's a rundown of them<br>
</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>The Four Networking System Exams</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Environment (Exam 
    70-290)</li>
  <li>Implementing, Managing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 
    Network Infrastructure (Exam 70-291)</li>
  <li>Planning and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network Infrastructure 
    (Exam 70-293)</li>
  <li>Planning, Implementing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 
    Active Directory Infrastructure (Exam 70-294)</li>
</ol>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>Client Operating System Exams (pick one)</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
    (Exam 70-270)</li>
  <li>Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
    Exam 70-2102)</li>
</ol>
<p>(With Vista now out, expect a new addition here)</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>The Design Exams (pick one)</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Designing a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Active Directory and Network Infrastructure 
    (Exam 70-2973)</li>
  <li>Designing Security for a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network (Exam 70-2983)</li>
</ol>
<p> <b><span class="TextIndent2">The Elective Exam (one exam needed)</span></b><br>
  <br>
  For the elective exam, you have 17 different subjects to choose from, depending 
  on what you want to specialise in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MCSE Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you already have a role working as a junior systems engineer, then the MCSE 
  is still a worthy qualification to take. If only because most employers will 
  have heard of it! Avoid the Boot Camp approach, though, unless you know your 
  stuff. For those not yet working in a network environment, we recommend getting 
  a job in junior role, and gaining some valuable experience. Then you can decide 
  if the very-expensive MCSE is for you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA)</h2>
<p>This qualification is similar to the MSCE, but you don't need as much knowledge. 
  With the MCSE, you'll be planning and designing the server systems that a medium 
  to large business will use. For the MCSA, you'll be maintaining the systems, 
  but not planning and designing. In other words, everything will be up and running. 
  It's the job of the system administrator to keep it that way. If the network 
  goes down, you'll be expected to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MCSA - What's involved</h3>
<p>To earn the title of MCSA, you need to pass three Core exams and one Elective 
  exam. Once you've passed four exams, the qualification is yours. The Core exams 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Environment (Exam 
    70-290)</li>
  <li>Implementing, Managing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 
    Network Infrastructure (Exam 70-291)</li>
  <li>Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
    (Exam 70-270)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the elective exam, you can either do the Microsoft Certified Desktop Support 
  Technician (MCDST) exam, or you have your choice of passing two of the Comptia 
  exams. The two Comptia exams you need are <a href="comptia-A-plus-2.html">Comptia 
  A+</a>, and either <a href="comptia-network-plus-2.html">Comptia Network+</a> 
  or Comptia Server+.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MCSA Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you already have a Comptia A+ or Comptia Network/Server+, then the MCSA 
  could be an excellent choice of next certificate. Don't be expecting to set 
  up the Windows servers with this qualification, but maintaining a large network 
  can be a very challenging career. And if it everything stops working, guess 
  who they'll be shouting at? </p>
