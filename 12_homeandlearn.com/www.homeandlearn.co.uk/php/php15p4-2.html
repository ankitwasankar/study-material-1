<p><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Survey/Poll tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="php15p1-2.html">Build your own Survey/Poll</a>, along with all 
  the files you need.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <a href="php15p3-2.html">previous section</a>, you saw how to code for 
  setting a question in your Survey. We'll now look at the Survey page.</p>
<p>The survey itslef can be found in the survey folder and is called <b>survey.php</b>. 
  Open up this page in a browser by typing the following address:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">127.0.0.1/survey/survey.php</p>
<p>You should see this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/survey10-2.jpg" width="171" height="207" border="1" alt="The Survey"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">All we have here is a question, and three possible answers. To 
  vote, you select an answer and click the button. When you do, you're taken to 
  another page which thanks you for voting. On the page, there is also a button 
  that allows you to view the results. Let's see how it all works.</p>
<p>To see the code for the survey, open up <b>survey.php</b> in your text editor. 
  The first line you'll see is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>include</b> 'sqlSurvey.php';</p>
<p>The include file is an important one. Open up this file (also in the survey 
  folder), and you'll see that it's just a SQL command. This SQL is used to pull 
  a question from the database. </p>
<p>The code is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$qNum = 'q4';</p>
<p class="indent_small">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tblquestions WHERE tblquestions.QID 
  = '$qNum'&quot;;</p>
<p>Only two lines long! The first line sets the question number. This is the QID 
  field from the tblQuestions table. To set a new question, the only thing you 
  have to change is this value. Try it. Change 'q4' to one of the other three 
  values in the table: q3, q2, or q1. Save the file, and reload survey.php in 
  your browser. You should see the question and answers change.</p>
<p>The important part of the SQL line is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">WHERE tblquestions.QID = '$qNum'</p>
<p>We're saying select all the records WHERE the QID field matches the value in 
  the variable called <b>$qNum</b>. That's enough to pull the question and answers 
  from the table! But although the file is included on the first line, the code 
  inside of it doesn't get run till a little later.</p>
<p>The next few lines just set up some variables, and put default values in them. 
  After that, we add the code that opens up the database. You've met all this 
  before, so we won't go into it.</p>
<p>The part of the code that uses the include file is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$result = mysql_query($SQL);</p>
<p>The variable called<b> $SQL</b> is in the include file. The survey code can 
  see this variable because of the include directive. So it knows what's inside 
  of it.</p>
<p>If mysql_query( ) succeeds, we can put the values into an array with the next 
  line (though you should write could for false values inside of $result):</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$db_field = <b>mysql_fetch_assoc(</b> $result <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>The data from the SQL is then placed into an array called <b>$db_field</b>. 
  You can get at these values like this:</p>
<P class="indent_big">$qID = $db_field['QID'];<br>
  $question = $db_field['Question'];<br>
  $A = $db_field['qA'];<br>
  $B = $db_field['qB'];<br>
  $C = $db_field['qC'];</P>
<p>Here, we're returning the values from the following fields in the table: QID, 
  Question, qA, qB, and qC. We've put these into variables of their own.</p>
<p>Once we have the question and the answers, we can put these into the HTML on 
  the page. There are two HTML forms on the page. The first is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;FORM NAME =&quot;form1&quot; METHOD =&quot;GET&quot; 
  ACTION =&quot;process.php&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;?PHP print $question; ?&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;P&gt;<br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE = 'Radio' Name ='q' value= 'A' &lt;?PHP print $answerA; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?PHP 
  print $A; ?&gt;<br>
  &lt;P&gt;<br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE = 'Radio' Name ='q' value= 'B' &lt;?PHP print $answerB; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?PHP 
  print $B; ?&gt;<br>
  &lt;P&gt;<br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE = 'Radio' Name ='q' value= 'C' &lt;?PHP print $answerC; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?PHP 
  print $C; ?&gt;<br>
  &lt;P&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;INPUT TYPE = &quot;Submit&quot; Name = &quot;Submit1&quot; 
  VALUE = &quot;Click here to vote&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
<p>The question from our code is placed on the page with this line:</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;?PHP print $question; ?&gt;</p>
<p>This is the value that we got from the field in the tblQuestions table. </p>
<p>The code for the answers is then added to the radio button on the form:</p>
<p class="indent_small">value= 'A' &lt;?PHP print $answerA; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?PHP 
  print $A; ?&gt;</p>
<p>The &quot;print $answerA&quot; part will just add a value of checked or unchecked 
  to the radio button, depending on whether it was selected or not. An answer 
  is added to the radio button like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;?PHP print $A; ?&gt;</p>
<p>Whatever data we pulled from the <b>A</b> &quot;field&quot; in the table will 
  end up in the variable called <b>$A</b>. This is then printed to the page. </p>
<p>If the button is clicked, though, we're sending it to a page called process.php. 
  We'll take a look at that in a moment, but notice the second Form on the page:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;FORM NAME =&quot;form2&quot; METHOD =&quot;GET&quot; 
  ACTION =&quot;viewResults.php&quot;&gt;</p>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;INPUT TYPE = &quot;Submit&quot; Name = &quot;Submit2&quot; 
  VALUE = &quot;View results&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE = &quot;Hidden&quot; Name = &quot;h1&quot; VALUE = &lt;?PHP print 
  $qID; ?&gt;&gt;</P>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
<P>This is for the &quot;View Results&quot; page. When this button is clicked, 
  it goes to a new page: viewResults.php. But there is a crucial HTML form element 
  in the form code:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;INPUT TYPE = &quot;Hidden&quot; Name = &quot;h1&quot; 
  VALUE = &lt;?PHP print $qID; ?&gt;&gt;</P>
<p>This sends the QID number to the viewResults page. We can then use this value 
  to pull the correct records from the two tables. You'll see how this works soon. 
  But one more thing to notice: both forms use the GET method to hand data to 
  the next page. Now let's move on to the code for the <b>process.php</b> page.</p>
