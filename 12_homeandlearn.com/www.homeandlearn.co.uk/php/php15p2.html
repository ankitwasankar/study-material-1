					<p><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Survey/Poll tutorial. The first 
          part is here: <a href="php15p1.html">Build your own Survey/Poll</a>, 
          along with all the files you need.</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the <a href="php15p1.html">previous part</a> of this lesson, you 
          opened <a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/mysql3.jpg', 730, 440);return false">the 
          phpMyAdmin screen</A>. With this still open, click on &quot;<b>Please 
          select a database</b>&quot;. Have a look at the items on the drop down 
          list. You should see one called surveytest:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/survey3.jpg" width="198" height="297" alt="The surveytest database" border="1"></p>
        <P>If you can't see surveytest there, it means you haven't copied the 
          surveytest folder to the correct place.</P>
        <p>If you can see surveytest, select it from the drop down list. You should 
          see the names of two tables appear:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/survey4.jpg" width="194" height="253" alt="The two tables in the surveytest database" border="1"></p>	
<P>Click on <b>tblQuestions</b>, and you'll see the Structure for this Table (it's 
  too big to fit on this page, so click below to see it): </P>
        <p align="center"> <a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/survey5.jpg', 700, 340);return false"> 
          The Structure for the tblQuestions Table</A> (opens in a new window 
          - 59K</p>
<p align="left">Under the <b>Table</b> heading, you'll see the two tables 
          in this database: <b>answers</b> and <b>tblQuestions</b>. Click on the 
          <b>Browse</b> icon for <b>tblQuestions</b>, as in the image below:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/survey6.jpg" width="360" height="132" alt="Browse the tblQuestions Table" border="1"></p>
        <p>You will be taken to the Field names and Rows in the table:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/survey7.jpg" width="473" height="172" alt="The questions in the Table" border="1"></p>
        <p>The Field names run from left to right, and are important. They are:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>QID<br>
          Question<br>
          qA<br>
          qB<br>
          qC</b></p>
        <p>The <b>tblQuestions</b> table above has four rows of data, one for 
          each question. The <b>QID</b> field is the one to pay attention to. 
          The values in the sample table are <b>q1</b>, <b>q2</b>, <b>q3</b>, 
          and <b>q4</b>. This QID field is the <b>Primary Key</b> in this table. 
          This means that the data in this field has to be unique. You can then 
          use this QID field to identify each row in the table. This same field, 
          QID, is also in the <b>answers</b> table, along with the <b>qA</b>, 
          <b>qB</b>, <b>qC</b> fields. This allows you to select all the records 
          in both tables based on the QID field. You just pull all the records 
          that match. For example, you can say &quot;Select all the records in 
          both tables where the QID field equals q1&quot;. </p>
        <p>Take a look at the answers table by clicking the link on the left hand 
          side. Then click on <b>Browse</b> at the top. You should see this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/survey8.jpg" width="344" height="167" alt="The answers Table" border="1"></p>
        <p>In the answers table, the unique field (the primary key) is the ID 
          field. This is just an auto incrementing number that you used in an 
          earlier section. You don't have to worry about this field. But notice 
          that the <b>QID</b> field is also there, along with the same values 
          from the <b>tblQuestions</b> table: <b>q1</b>, <b>q2</b>, <b>q3</b>, 
          and <b>q4</b>. This matching <b>QID</b> field in the <b>answers</b> 
          table is something called a foreign key, in database terminology. Joining 
          data from a primary key in one table to a foreign key in another is 
          common technique in database creation. You do this when you want to 
          keep data separate, and to avoid having too many fields in a single 
          table. It also speeds things up. In our example database, we can keep 
          the questions and answers separate.</p>
        <p>(NOTE: If you have some knowledge about databases, you'll know about 
          Referential Integrity. Unfortunately, phpMyAdmin doesn't enforce this. 
          So if you delete a row from one table, the corresponding row in another 
          table won't get deleted - you have to code for that yourself!)</p>
        <p>The A, B, and C fields in the answers table record how many people 
          voted for each option of your question. So, for question four (q4) 28 
          people voted for option A, 127 people voted for option B, and 52 people 
          voted for option C. If you look at the matching row (q4) in the tblQuestions 
          table you'll see that the question was: Do you believe in UFOs? (These 
          answers were entered by us - it's not real data!)</p>
        <p>Now that you have a good idea about how the database works, let's go 
          through the code that sets a question.</p>
