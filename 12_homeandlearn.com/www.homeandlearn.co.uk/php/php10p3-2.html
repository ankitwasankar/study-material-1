<P>A better method to open files is with <b>fopen</b>( ). This function gives 
  you more options that, such as setting whether the file is for reading only, 
  for writing to as well, and a few more options. Here's an example (this assumes 
  that you've read the short introduction on <a href="php10p1-2.html">the previous 
  page</a>):</P>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$file_contents = <b>fopen(</b> &quot;dictionary.txt&quot;, 
  &quot;r&quot; <b>)</b>;<br>
  print $file_contents;<br>
  fclose($file_contents);</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">?&gt;</p>
<p>Run this script and see what happens. You should see something like the following 
  printed out:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">Resource id #2</p>
<p>Not quite what you were expecting! The reason is that <b>fopen</b>( ) doesn't 
  actually read the contents of a file. All it does is to set a <b>pointer</b> 
  to the file you want to open. It then returns what's call a file handle. All 
  you're doing is telling PHP to remember the location of the file. </p>
<p>The &quot;r&quot; on the end means &quot;open this file for reading only&quot;. 
  We'll see <a href="php10p4-2.html">other options</a> in a moment. But now that 
  you've told PHP to remember the location of the file you want to open, how do 
  you read the contents of the file?</p>
<p>One way is to use <b>fgets</b>( ). This will read a specified number of character 
  on a single line of text. It's typically used to loop round and read each line 
  of text. In the example below, we're printing out each line separately. When 
  you're using <b>fgets</b>( ), you also need to check when the end of the file 
  has been reached. This is done with the inbuilt function <b>feof</b> - <b>f</b>ile, 
  <b>e</b>nd <b>o</b>f <b>f</b>ile. Try the script out, then we'll explain what's 
  happening:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">$file_handle = fopen(&quot;dictionary.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_big">while (!feof($file_handle)) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">$line_of_text = fgets($file_handle);<br>
  print $line_of_text . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="indent_big">fclose($file_handle);</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">?&gt;</p>
<p>What you should find is that the contents are printed out on separate lines. 
  But how does it work?</p>
<p>The first line is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$file_handle = <b>fopen(</b> &quot;dictionary.txt&quot;, 
  &quot;r&quot; <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>What we're doing here is asking PHP to open up a file, and remember the location. 
  The location is stored as a file handle. We're putting this into a variable 
  called <b>$file_handle</b>. So we haven't yet read the contents of the file 
  &#150; we've just asked PHP to remember where it is.</p>
<p>The next line is tricky! It's a while loop:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">while ( <b>!feof(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b> ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">}</p>
<p>There's really two parts to this. There's the while loop:</p>
<p class="indent_big">while () {</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>And then there's the condition for the while loop:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>!feof(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b></p>
<p>A while loop, remember, just goes round and round until you tell it to stop. 
  It goes round and round while a condition is true. The condition between the 
  round brackets was our strange <b>!feof</b> line.</p>
<p>The function feof( ) means &quot;file end of file&quot;. It tells PHP when 
  the end of a file has been reached. You put the file between the round brackets 
  of the function:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>feof(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b></p>
<p>This means, end of the file referred to in the variable called <b>$file_handle</b>. 
  Except, we've used the NOT operator ( ! ):</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>!feof(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b></p>
<p>That's because we want to keep looping while the end of the has NOT been reached:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">while ( <b>!feof(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b> ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">}</p>
<p>This whole line, then, reads: &quot;While the end of the file has NOT been 
  reached, loop round the file pointed to in $file_handle.&quot; As soon as the 
  end of the file has been reached, the while loop will end.</p>
<p>Inside the while loop, the first line is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$line_of_text = <b>fgets(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>We're using the fgets( ) function to get a line of text from our file. Again, 
  we need the file handle:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>fgets(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>So we get a line of text from our file, and then place the line into a variable. 
  We then print out the line of text:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print $line_of_text . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p>As well as printing out the line of text, we're adding a HTML line break.</p>
<p>The last line in the code is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>fclose(</b> $file_handle <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>All this does is to close the open file. It tells PHP that the pointer to the 
  file is no longer needed. You should always close files that you have opened 
  with <b>fopen</b>().</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code is a bit tricky, when you're meeting it for the first time. But this 
  kind of file opening is useful when you need to read each line of text. With 
  our file, for example, we could separate each half of the line. We might want 
  to put the abbreviations into one list box and the meanings into another. </p>
<p>Another point to bear in mind about fgets is that it can take (and often does) 
  a second argument &#150; the size of the line to read:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">fgets($file_handle, <b>line_size</b>);</p>
<p>The line size needs to be in bytes. The default is 1024. But this line size 
  is only optional in PHP version 4.2 and above. If your version is earlier than 
  this, then you may get an error if you miss out the line size:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">fgets($file_handle, <b>1024</b>);</p>
<p>If you're really packing a lot of information into each line, then just increase 
  the number for line size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll see other options for fopen, rather than the &quot;r&quot; 
  above.</p>
