<p><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Survey/Poll tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="php15p1.html">Build your own Survey/Poll</a>, along with all 
  the files you need.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <a href="php15p2.html">previous part</a> of this lesson, you had a look 
  at the structure for the Survey database. We're now going to look at the code 
  for setting a question. The web page itself, remember, looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/survey1.jpg', 730, 350);return false">The 
  Form to set a question</a> (opens in a new window - 43K)</p>
<p>Using your favourite text editor, open up the file called <b>setQuestion.php</b> 
  again, and take a look at the code. Most of it is code you've already met. In 
  the first two sections we just get the data entered in the textboxes on the 
  form (the questions and three possible options), check for any unwanted script 
  tags, and then open up a connection to the database. The first new code is this:</p>
<P class="indent_small">//============================================<br>
  // GET THE LAST QUESTION NUMBER<br>
  //============================================</P>
<p class="indent_small">$SQL = &quot;Select * FROM tblQuestions&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_small">$result = mysql_query($SQL);<br>
  $numRows = mysql_num_rows($result);</p>
<p class="indent_small">$boolLastRow = mysql_data_seek($result, ($numRows - 1));</p>
<p class="indent_small">$row = mysql_fetch_row($result);</p>
<p class="indent_small">$qID = $row[0];</p>
<p class="indent_small">$next_Q_Number = ltrim($qID, 'q');<br>
  $next_Q_Number++;<br>
  $question_Number = 'q' . $next_Q_Number;</p>
<p>As the comments say, we're getting the last question number from the <b>tblQuestions</b> 
  table. We need to do this because the primary key doesn't auto increment. </p>
<p>Because the primary key is a unique field, the auto increment feature of MySQL 
  would have added one to the primary key for us. But we've made our own unique 
  field to be used as a primary key (q1, q2, q3, etc), so we're going to have 
  to increment the values with code. The idea is that we get the last number value 
  from the QID field, then add 1 to it. (For simplicity's sake, there's no checking 
  to see if the value we write back to the database is indeed unique. If it isn't, 
  you'll get an error. You'll see how to code for this in the next section.)</p>
<p>The code, then, starts off by getting all the records from the <b>tblQuestions</b> 
  table:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tblQuestions&quot;;</p>
<p>Next, we try to run this query:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$result = mysql_query($SQL);</p>
<p>We could check here if the value in the variable called <b>$result</b> is true. 
  If it wasn't, we could display an error. (Another thing for you to do!) But 
  we're keeping things simple, so you can see how all this works. </p>
<p>The next thing to do is to get the number of rows in the table:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$numRows = mysql_num_rows($result);</p>
<p>We need to get the number of rows so that we can move the pointer to the last 
  row in the database. We want to get this last row so that we can check the QID 
  field. Remember: we're trying to add 1 to the value in the QID field - to increment 
  it. The code that moves the internal pointer to the last row in the database 
  is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$boolLastRow = mysql_data_seek( $result, ($numRows - 1) 
  );</p>
<p>We're using an inbuilt PHP function called <b>mysql_data_seek</b>( ). This 
  allows you to jump to any row in a table. Between the round brackets of the 
  function, you first type the name of your resource (<b>$result</b>, for us). 
  Then, after a comma, you put the row that you want to jump to: <b>$numRows - 
  1</b>. The count with <b>mysql_data_seek</b>( ) starts at zero, so we're deducting 
  one from the number of rows in our table. Otherwise, we'd get an error about 
  no such row found. We're returning all this to a boolean variable called <b>$boolLastRow</b>. 
  You can write an error message, if this returns a value of false. But we're 
  leaving out the error checking here.</p>
<p>Once we've moved the pointer to the last row in the table, we can fetch the 
  data back:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$row = mysql_fetch_row($result);</p>
<p>You've met the inbuilt function <b>mysql_fetch_row</b>( ) before. It fetches 
  a row of data, and puts it all in to an array. You can then access the array, 
  and manipulate the data.</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$qID = $row[0];</p>
<p>The QID field is at position zero in the array (it's the first field in the 
  database). So we just use <b>$row[0]</b> to return the value. This is then put 
  in to the variable we've called <b>$qID</b>. This variable will then hold the 
  last QID value from the table. The format we're using for the QID field is to 
  type a letter &quot;q&quot; followed by a number. To increment the QID field, 
  we can just add 1 to the number then join that number to the letter &quot;q&quot;. 
  The next few lines do exactly that:</p>
<P class="indent_small">$next_Q_Number = ltrim($qID, 'q');<br>
  $next_Q_Number++;<br>
  $question_Number = 'q' . $next_Q_Number;</P>
<p>We use the<b> ltrim</b> function to strip off the letter &quot;q&quot;. This 
  leaves just the number itself. You can then increment this number (<b>next_Q_Number++</b>). 
  The final line joins the new data back together:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3"><b>$question_Number = 'q' . $next_Q_Number;</b></p>
<p>This adds the new number to the letter &quot;q&quot;, and then stores it in 
  a variable called <b>$question_Number</b>. It's this question number that will 
  get written to the QID fields in both the <b>tblQuestions</b> table and the 
  answers table.</p>
<p>The next two sections use the INSERT INTO command to add the new question to 
  the database. The first thing to do is to add the question to the tblQuestions 
  table. The rather long SQL line that does that is this:</p>
<P class="indent_small">$SQL = &quot;INSERT INTO tblquestions (QID, Question, 
  qA, qB, qC) VALUES ('$question_Number', '$question', '$answerA', '$answerB', 
  '$answerC')&quot;;</P>
<p>You've met code like this in a previous section. You should be able to figure 
  out what it does: adds the data into the Field names mentioned in the first 
  round brackets.</p>
<p>To update the table, we run the SQL query:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$result = mysql_query($SQL);</p>
<p>The next SQL command is slightly different:</p>
<P class="indent_small">$SQL = &quot;INSERT INTO answers (QID, A, B, C) VALUES 
  ('$question_Number', 0, 0, 0)&quot;;</P>
  <p>Again, it's an INSERT INTO command, but note that we're now updating 
          the answers table. The VALUES between the round brackets are:</p>
        
<p class="TextIndent3">'$question_Number', 0, 0, 0</p>
        <p>The value inside of <b>$question_Number</b> will be the QID number. 
          But the next three values are all zero. This sets up the answers table, 
          and ensures that the default options are all filled in. A, B and C, 
          remember, will hold the number of votes. We start them off at zero because 
          nobody has voted yet!</p>
        <p>And that's about it for setting the question. We've covered quite a 
          lot of ground in a short space of time, so let's review what we did.</p>
<OL>
<LI>Created two tables in the same database</LI>
<LI>Had a primary key in one table that is joined to a foreign key in the other table</LI>
<LI>Wrote code to move an internal pointer to the last record in a table</LI>
<LI>Returned a specified row, and incremented a value to be used as a unique key</LI>
<LI>Inserted a new record into two tables, using the same field in both</LI>
</OL>
<P>Probably the most important thing to learn in this section is how to join separate tables together using a primary/foreign key combination. We'll use this technique again when we create a forum. For now, let's move on to the survey itself.</P>
