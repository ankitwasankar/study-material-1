<P>&nbsp;</P>
<p>Being able to include other files into your HTML code, or for your PHP scripts, 
  is a useful thing. The <b>include( )</b> function allows you do this. </p>
<p>Suppose you have a text file that you want to include in a web page that you've 
  already got up and running. You could copy and paste the text from the file 
  straight into you HTML. Or you could use the include( ) function</p>
<p>As an example for you to try, there are two files amongst <a href="../downloads.html">the 
  ones you downloaded</a> (in the scripts folder), called <b>include.php</b> and 
  <b>textfile.txt</b>. Load up the one called <b>include.php</b>.</p>
<p>Now take a look at the code for this page:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
  &lt;HEAD&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;TITLE&gt;Include files&lt;/TITLE&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;/HEAD&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;BODY&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;H3&gt;Normal text here &lt;/H3&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">Normal text written in a HTML Editor</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;H3&gt;Include File here&lt;/H3&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;?PHP include &quot;textfile.txt&quot; ; ?&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/BODY&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;/HTML&gt;</p>
<p>Our PHP code is in red. Here it is:</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">include &quot;textfile.txt&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">?&gt;</p>
<p>So in between PHP script tags, type the word <b>include</b>. After the word 
  include, type the name of the file you want to include on your page. Your filename 
  can either go after a space, and between quotation marks, or you can put it 
  in round brackets (again, with the quotes).</p>
<p>As well as including text, you can include HTML. This can save you lots of 
  work. For example, a web page typically contains a menu bar, with links to other 
  areas of your site. Something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/menu1.jpg" width="246" height="239" alt="A Menu Bar" border="1"></p>
<p>Suppose you decide to add a new section to your site. The new page should be 
  like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/menu2.jpg" width="243" height="258" alt="A new section added to the menu bar" border="1"> 
</p>
<p align="left">If your site contains lots of pages, that would mean having to 
  amend the HTML of all of them. A painful and dreaded task! Instead, use the 
  include( ) function. </p>
<p>To see how it works, load up the page called links.php that is among the files 
  you downloaded (in the scripts folder): you should see the first menu bar. This 
  has the include line, that points to another file - linksPage.txt (this is also 
  in the scripts folder).</p>
<p>If you open up the text file called linksPage.txt, you'll see that it's just 
  a HTML table. To get this table into the PHP page called links.php, we just 
  did this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">&lt;?PHP include &quot;linksPage.txt&quot; ?&gt;</p>
<p>The point is, if we had the include line on all pages of out site, and we had 
  to add a new section, we could just change the text file <b>linksPage.txt</b>. 
  This change would then mean that all the pages in the site would be updated!</p>
<p>Try it yourself. Add the following line to the page called <b>linksPage.txt</b>. 
  Put it between the TABLE tags:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;TR&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;TD height=&quot;30&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot; 
  bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;a href=&quot;links.php&quot;&gt;New Section&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/TD&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;/TR&gt;</p>
<p>Save the page, and then load up <b>links.php</b> again. You should see a new 
  section added to your menu bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Including Scripts</h3>
<p>You can also use the include( ) function for scripts. You could include those 
  valuable error checking functions that you've stored in one PHP file. Or just 
  use it to cut down on the amount of code in the page. </p>
<p>As an example, load up the page called <b>includeScript.php</b> (in the scripts 
  folder that <a href="../downloads.html">you downloaded</a>). The code is quite 
  simple. It's just this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">include &quot;myOtherScript.php&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;This was printed from the includeScript.php&quot;;<br>
  print &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">doPrint();</p>
<p class="indent_small">?&gt;</p>
<p>The above script uses include to include another PHP script - myOtherScript.php 
  (also in the scripts folder). The function called doPrint() is in myOtherScript.php. 
  If you open that file, you'll see it's just this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">function doPrint() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;This was printed from the myOtherScript.php&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">?&gt;</p>
<p>Load up the page called <b>includeScript.php</b> in your browser. You should 
  see two lines printed out.</p>
<p><br>
  So, <b>include</b> is a very useful function &#150; one of the most useful inbuilt 
  PHP functions available to you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll look at some of the security issues with the code 
  you've written so far. It's only a short section, but it's essential reading!</p>
