<P>PHP allows you to split a line of text into its component parts. For example, 
  if you were reading from a text file line by line you might have to break apart 
  a line like this:</P>
<p class="TextIndent3">Poll number 1, 1500, 250, 150, 100, 1000</p>
<p>If this were a poll, and you want to display the results for all to see, then 
  you might be trying to print something like this on the page:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b><U>Poll Number 1</U></b><br>
  <b>Respondents: 1500</b><br>
  Answer A: 250<br>
  Answer B: 150<br>
  Answer C: 100<br>
  Answer D: 1000</p>
<p>The line of text is separated by commas. As the line is read in (which we'll 
  see how to do in a later section), you'd be passing it to a variable. You'd 
  then need to chop the text up, based on the comma. We can simulate that. First, 
  pass the text to a variable:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$text_line = &quot;Poll number 1, 1500, 250, 150, 100, 
  1000&quot;;</p>
<p>The next job is to split this text apart, so that PHP knows about all the separate 
  pieces. The pieces we want are:</p>
<p align="center"><b><u>Poll number 1</u></b><br>
  1500<br>
  250<br>
  150<br>
  100<br>
  1000</p>
<p>To split lines of text, the gloriously sounding <b>explode( )</b> function 
  can be used. You just provided it with the text you want to split, and the character 
  that is used to separate each piece. Here's the syntax:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>explode(</b> separator, string_to_split <b>)</b></p>
<p>In between the round brackets of explode( ) the separator you want to use goes 
  first, followed by a comma, then the string you want to split. For our line 
  of code above, you'd do this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$text_line = &quot;Poll number 1, 1500, 250, 150, 
  100, 1000&quot;;<br>
  $text_line = <b>explode(</b> &quot;,&quot; , $text_line<b> )</b>;</p>
<p>So we're saying, &quot;Look for a comma in the text, and split the line of 
  text into separate pieces.&quot; Once PHP does its job, it puts all the parts 
  into the variable on the left hand side of the equals sign ( = ), which was<b> 
  $text_line</b> for us. This variable will then be an array!</p>
<p>To get at the pieces of the array, access it in the normal manner. Here's some 
  code to try:</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">$text_line = &quot;Poll number 1, 1500, 250, 150, 100, 
  1000&quot;;<br>
  $text_line = explode(&quot;,&quot;,$text_line);</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print $text_line[0];</p>
<p class="indent_big">?&gt;</p>
<p>Run the code and see what happens. Then change the 0 of the print statement 
  to 1, then to 2, then to 3, then to 4, then to 5, and finally to 5. What happens 
  when you enter 6 as the array Key number?</p>
<p>To see all the parts of your array, you can use a different form of print statement. 
  Try changing the print line in your code from this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print $text_line[0];</p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print_r($text_line);</p>
<p>Run your code and see what happens.</p>
<p>You should see your array details printed out, with all the Keys and the Values. 
  The <b>print_r( ) </b>statement is quite useful, when you're trying to debug 
  your code.</p>
<p>And it does show that<b> explode( )</b> works &#150; all of the values are 
  in an array!</p>
<p>Another way to access all the element returned by explode( ) is with a for 
  loop:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$text_line = &quot;Poll number 1, 1500, 250, 150, 100, 1000&quot;;<br>
  $text_line = explode(&quot;,&quot;,$text_line);</p>
<p class="indent_big">for ($start=0; $start &lt; count($text_line); $start++) 
  {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print $text_line[$start] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>In the for loop above, we set a start value to zero. The end condition is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$start &lt; count($text_line)</p>
<p>We use the count( ) function to get the number of elements in the array called 
  <b>$text_line</b>. Each time round the loop, PHP checks to see if the value 
  in the variable called <b>$start </b>is less than how many elements are in the 
  array. It breaks out of the loop when $start is NOT less than count($text_line).</p>
<p>Inside the loop, we have a normal print statement:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print $text_line[$start] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p>To get at each element in the array, this is used:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>$text_line[</b>$start<b>]</b></p>
<p>The variable called <b>$start</b> will be different each time round the loop. 
  So the value at each position is printed. The &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; at the 
  end just adds a HTML line break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as exploding a line of text, you'll need to know how to join the parts 
  back together again. We'll do that in the next part.</p>
