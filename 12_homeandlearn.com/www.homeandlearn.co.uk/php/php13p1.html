<P>In this section, you'll see how to manipulate the simple Address Book <a href="php12p1.html">database 
  you've just created</a>. Using PHP code, you'll first open the database. Once 
  the database is open, you can then read its contents. You'll also need to know 
  how to add new records, and delete records. First, though, a database has to 
  be opened, before you can do anything with it.</P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Opening a Connection to a MySQL database</h3>
<p>PHP has a lot of inbuilt functions you can use to manipulate databases. In 
  PHP version 5, a lot more were added as well! Here, we'll stay with the inbuilt 
  functions for versions earlier than PHP 5. But if you have version 5, it's well 
  worth researching the newer database functions. A good place to start is php.net. 
  To open <a href="php12p2.html">our Address Book database</a>, we'll use the 
  following inbuilt functions:</p>
<p align="center"><b>mysql_connect()<br>
  mysql_select_db()<br>
  mysql_close()</b></p>
<p>The approached we'll take has three steps:</p>
<OL>
  <LI>Open a connection to MySQL itself</LI>
  <LI>Specify the database we want to open</LI>
  <LI>Close the connection</LI>
</OL>
<p>Let's do Step 1 on the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Step 1 - Open a connection to MySQL</b></h4>
<p>The first job is to actually connect to MySQL. As it's name suggests, <b>mysql_connect( 
  )</b> does exactly that. Here's the code we're going to be using. But this is 
  just to get your started. It is recommended that you don't dash off and use 
  this on the internet! This is for learning purposes only. </p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_big">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;Connection to the Server opened&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_small">?&gt;</p>
<p>Save your work and try it out on your server (this assumes that you have the 
  Address Book database <a href="php12p2.html">we created earlier</a>, and that 
  it is in the <a href="php12p4.html">data folder of MySQL</a>. If you don't, 
  you can download all the files <a href="../downloads.html">here</a>.).</p>
<p>The first four lines are just setting up variables, and putting something in 
  them:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p>The username we're trying here is &quot;root&quot; and the password is blank. 
  These are the MySQL defaults. You don't need to change these, in most cases.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you won't have any errors. But the line that connects to MySQL is 
  this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>mysql_connect(</b>$server, $user_name, $password<b>)</b>;</p>
<p>So you type the name of the function first (<b> mysql_connect</b> ), followed 
  by the round brackets. In between the round brackets, you need three things: 
  the name of your server, your MySQL username, and your MySQL password. These 
  can be entered directly, like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>mysql_connect(</b> '127.0.0.1', 'root', '' <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>Or as variables, like we did at first:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);</p>
<p>And that's all you need to get you connected to MySQL. But we haven't connected 
  to the database yet. That's Step 2 on our list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2 - Specify the database you want to open</h4>
<p>In our code, we set up a variable with the name of our database:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;</p>
<p>We now need to do something with this variable. So add this new line to your 
  code (the new line is in blue text):</p>
<p class="indent_big">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">$db_found = mysql_select_db($database);</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;Connection to the Server opened&quot;;</p>
<p>You use the <b>mysql_select_db</b>( ) function to specify which database you 
  want to open. The function then returns a true/false value. If it finds your 
  database, a value of <b>true</b> is returned; if your database can't be found 
  then a value of <b>false</b> is returned. You can use some logic to test if 
  the database was found. Change the last two lines of your code to this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$db_found = mysql_select_db($database);</p>
<p class="indent_big">if ($db_found) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Database Found&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Database NOT Found&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>Now change the database name from this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;</p>
<p>to something like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$database = &quot;addressbook2&quot;;</p>
<p>Run your code again, and you should see Database NOT Found printed out (unless 
  you have a database called addressbook2). Change the database name back to addressbook. 
</p>
<p>But there's another option you can use for <b>mysql_select_db</b> - something 
  called a resource link identifier. It's just a file handle that you used in 
  an earlier section (opening text files). You use it like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">$db_handle = mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">$db_found = mysql_select_db($database, $db_handle);</p>
<p class="indent_big">if ($db_found) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">print &quot;Database Found &quot; . $db_handle;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;Database NOT Found &quot; . $db_handle;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>So when we connect to the database, we're now using this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$db_handle = mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);</p>
<p>It's just the same as before, except we're returning a value from the mysql_connect 
  function, and putting it into a variable called $db_handle. When we connect 
  to the database, we can use this file handle:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$db_found = <b>mysql_select_db(</b>$database, $db_handle<b>)</b>;</p>
<p>The resource link identifier (file handle) goes after the name of the database 
  you want to open. You can then use this file handle to refer to your database 
  connection.</p>
<p>Now that we've connected to MySQL, and connected to a database, it's time to 
  close the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Step 3 - Close the connection</h4>
<p>Closing a connection to a database is quite easy. If you've used a file handle, 
  as above, you just do this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>mysql_close(</b> $db_handle <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>Otherwise, you don't need to bother. It's recommended that you take the file 
  handle approach, though. That's what we'll be doing from now on. </p>
<p>So, we'll add a line to close our connection. Here what your code should now 
  look like:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_small">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_small">$db_handle = mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);</p>
<p class="indent_small">$db_found = mysql_select_db($database, $db_handle);</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ($db_found) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;Database Found &quot;;<br>
  mysql_close($db_handle);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;Database NOT Found &quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">?&gt;</p>
<p>Now that we've got a connection to the database, it's time to look at how you 
  can access the data in the database. We'll do that in the next part.</p>
