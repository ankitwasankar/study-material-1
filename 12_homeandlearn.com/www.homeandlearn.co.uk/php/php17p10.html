<P><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Foruml tutorial. The first part is here: 
  <a href="php16p1.html">Build your own Forum</a>, along with all the files you 
  need. The previous lesson is <a href="php17p9.html">here</a>.</i></P>
<p>There's not too much code in the <b>results.php</b> page. All we need to do 
  here is to INSERT a reply to a post into the correct database table. Open up 
  the code, and we'll take a look at it.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is the function at the top of the page &#150; <b>getReplySQL</b>( 
  ). This takes one argument &#150; the section code for the forum. <br>
</p>
<p>After the function, we check to see if the form was submitted using the POST 
  method:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">}</p>
<p>If this returns a value of true, then we grab that data from the form:</p>
<P class="indent_big">$secID = $_POST['h1'];<br>
  $posID = $_POST['h2'];<br>
  $memID = $_POST['h3'];<br>
  $repText = $_POST['post'];</P>
<p>We're grabbing all those HIDDEN values from the form (which had the NAMES <b>h1</b>, 
  <b>h2</b>, and <b>h3</b>), as well as the text in the textarea (which had the 
  NAME post). </p>
<p>The next three lines just add some single quotes. This is NOT how you'd want 
  to do it in your own forum! There are security issues here, because you're grabbing 
  text from a textarea and trying to INSERT it into a database. We covered the 
  security issues in an earlier section, but try this exercise:</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Login to the forum with one of the username/passwords you saw earlier (these 
  are in the textfile called <b>uandp.txt</b>, in your <b>forum</b> folder). Reply 
  to the post &quot;A Brand New Forum&quot;. You'll see this basic form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forum22.jpg" width="530" height="374" alt="A Basic Reply Form" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">If you just go ahead and click the button, the text <b>Some text 
  here</b> should get added to the database.</p>
<p>But surround the text with single quotes. Type this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>'</b>Some text here<b>'</b></p>
<p>Now click the button. You should see the message &quot;<b>No results</b>&quot;. 
  This is because the code couldn't execute the SQL with those single quotes added. 
  How would you solve this? Review the section on security, especially the parts 
  about SQL injection attacks. Wasn't there something about magic quotes, and 
  strip slashes? How would you use these to lessen a SQL injection attack? </p>
<p>Another secrurity issue to worry about is how much text to allow the user to 
  type into the textarea. You can check how long a string is with the strlen( 
  ) function. A good run-down on how to use this can be found in the PHP manual 
  here:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.strlen.php" target="_blank">http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.strlen.php</a></p>
<p>A simple way to use this would be:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">$strCount = strlen($repText);</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">if ($strCount &gt; 255) {</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print &quot;too many characters in your reply&quot;;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">//Do the rest of the code here</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">}</p>
<p>This just prints an error message if the user types in more than 255 characters. 
  (However, we've set the reply text field in the database tables to MEDIUMTEXT. 
  This can hold far more characters than 255. If you're restricting users to 255 
  characters, then TINYTEXT would be a better option.)</p>
<p><br>
  But back to our (less than secure) code. We've just grabbed the data from the 
  FORM and placed it into variables:</p>
<P class="TextIndent3">$secID = $_POST['h1'];<br>
  $posID = $_POST['h2'];<br>
  $memID = $_POST['h3'];<br>
  $repText = $_POST['post'];</P>
<P>The secID will contain something like &quot;secWP&quot;, the posID will contain 
  something like &quot;pos1&quot;, and the member ID is always &quot;mem&quot; 
  plus a number (mem1, me2, etc). The $repText variable holds the reply the user 
  typed in the textarea.</P>
<p>The next code we have is some date code:</p>
<P class="TextIndent3">$date_today = date(&quot;Y-m-d H:i:s&quot;);<br>
  $date_today = &quot;'&quot; . $date_today . &quot;'&quot;;</P>
<p>The characters we're using between the round brackets of the date function 
  mean we want the year first, then the month, then the day. These will be separated 
  with the &quot;-&quot; character. We're also adding a time part that returns 
  Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. The second line adds single quotes to the date, 
  so we can use it in the SQL.</p>
<p>The next line is a call to the function at the top of the page:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$tableSQL = getReplySQL($secID);</p>
<p>The function returns SQL to be used against the database table. But it only 
  returns part of the SQL we need:</p>
<P class="TextIndent2">$sql = &quot;INSERT INTO wpreplies (threadID, memberID, 
  reply, dateReplied) VALUES &quot;;</P>
<P>In between the round brackets, we have the fields from the table. But we don't 
  yet have the VALUES we need to insert into these fileds. The next line in our 
  code adds the values. It's a long line that spills over into two on these pages:</P>
<P class="TextIndent2">$tableSQL = $tableSQL . &quot;(&quot; . $posID . &quot;,&quot; 
  . $memID . &quot;,&quot; . $repText . &quot;,&quot; . $date_today . &quot;)&quot;;</P>
<P>We're building up the $tableSQL string variable here. It already holds the 
  first part of the SQL we need. We're now adding the VALUES. We need the round 
  brackets, the data from the variables, and the commas. After the line is executed, 
  the string would be something like this:</P>
<P class="TextIndent2">&quot;INSERT INTO wpreplies (threadID, memberID, reply, 
  dateReplied) VALUES (pos1, mem1, &quot;My Reply&quot;, &quot;2006-10-22 13:30:14&quot;)&quot;</P>
<P>After we open a connection to the database, we try to execute the query:</P>
<p class="TextIndent2"> $result = mysql_query($tableSQL);</p>
<p>Then we check to see if the SQL is executed successfully:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">if ($result) {</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print &quot;Your Reply has been added to the Forum.&quot; 
  . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print &quot;&lt;A HREF = forumTest.php&gt;Back to the forum&lt;/A&gt;&quot; 
  . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print &quot;no results&quot; . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">}</p>
<p>And that's all we need to do on the this page: try to insert the reply into 
  a reply table in the database. Some of the error checking has been left out, 
  so as not to confuse the main techniques used. But you should implement the 
  error checking in your own code. Especially the checks to ward off attacks on 
  your database!<br>

  on the Forum</p>
