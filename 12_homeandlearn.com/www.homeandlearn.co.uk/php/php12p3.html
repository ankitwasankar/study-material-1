<p>You have four Fields in your table from the <a href="php12p2.html">previous 
  section</a>. Although they are set out in rows in the images, the rows are actually 
  the Columns you saw earlier &#150; the Fields. Each Field needs a name. So go 
  ahead and type the following for your Field names:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mysql9.jpg" width="227" height="144" alt="Set the Field Names" border="1"></p>
<p>So we have given each column in our table a name: <b>ID</b>, <b>First_Name</b>, 
  <b>Surname</b>, and <b>Address</b>. The next thing to set is what type of data 
  will be going in to each field - do you want to store text in this field, numbers, 
  Yes/No value, etc?</p>
<p>To set the type of data going into a field, you select an item from the <b>Type</b> 
  drop down list. Click the down arrow to see the following list you can choose 
  from:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/mysql10.jpg', 140, 500);return false"> 
  A List of the Field Types</a> (opens in a new window - 21K) </p>
<p align="left">As you can see from the image above, there's quite a lot! But 
  you won't use most them. For the values we have in our four fields, we want 
  to hold these Types:</p>
<p align="left" class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>ID</b> &#150; A number, used just 
  to identify each record. This needs to be unique for each record<br>
  <b>First_Name</b> &#150; Text<br>
  <b>Surname</b> &#150; Text<br>
  <b>Address</b> &#150; Text</p>
<p>If you look at the list, there is an INT but no Number; and there are four 
  different Text Types to choose from. We can use INT (meaning integer) for the 
  numbers, but again, there are a few Integer Types to choose from. And that's 
  leaving out things like float and double. Here's the difference between them, 
  though.</p>
<p><b><u>Integer Values</u></b></p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>TINYINT</b> Signed: -128 to 127. Unsigned: 
  0 to 255</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>SMALLINT</b> Signed: -32768 to 32767. Unsigned: 
  0 to 65535</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>MEDIUMINT</b> Signed: -8388608 to 8388607. 
  Unsigned: 0 to 16777215</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>INT</b> Signed: -2147483648 to 2147483647. 
  Unsigned: 0 to 4294967295</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>BIGINT</b> Signed: -9223372036854775808. Unsigned: 
  0 to 18446744073709551615</p>
<p>The signed and unsigned are for minus and non minus values. So if you need 
  to store negative values, you need to be aware of the signed ranges. If you 
  were using a TINYINT value, for example, you can go from minus 128 to positive 
  127. If you didn't need the minus value, you can go from 0 to positive 255.</p>
<p>For our address book, we have an ID field. We're using this just to identify 
  a record (row). Each record will be unique, so it will need a different number 
  for each. We can set it to one of the INT values. But which one?</p>
<p>If we set ID to TINYINT, then you'd run in to problem if you tried to store 
  more than 255 records. If you used SMALLINT, you'd have problems if you tried 
  to stored the details of friend number 65536. IF you have more than 65 and half 
  thousand friends, then you need a different INT type. We'll assume that you 
  don't, so we'll use SMALLINT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Text Types</h3>
<p>The length for the text types can be quite confusing. The MySQL manual says 
  this about the various lengths that each text type can hold:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>TINYTEXT</b> L+1 byte, where L &lt; 2^8 <br>
  <b>TEXT</b> L+2 bytes, where L &lt; 2^16<br>
  <b>MEDIUMTEXT</b> L+3 bytes, where L &lt; 2^24<br>
  <b>LONGTEXT</b> L+4 bytes, where L &lt; 2^32</p>
<p>This in not terribly helpful for beginners! So what does it mean. Well, the 
  L + 1 part means, &quot;The length of the string, plus 1 byte to store the value.&quot; 
  The translated values for each are approximately:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>TINYTEXT</b> 256 bytes<br>
  <b>TEXT</b> 64 KiloBytes<br>
  <b>MEDIUMTEXT</b> 16 MegaBytes<br>
  <b>LONGTEXT</b> 4 GigaBytes</p>
<p>To confuse the issue even more, you can also use CHAR and VARCHAR to store 
  your text. These are quite useful, if you know how many characters you want 
  to store. For example, for a UK postcode you don't need more than 9 characters, 
  and one of those will be a blank space. So there's no sense in setting a postcode 
  field to hold 4 gigabytes! Instead, use CHAR or VARCHAR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CHAR</h3>
<p>You specify how many characters you want the field to hold. The maximum value 
  is 255. For example:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">CHAR(10)</p>
<p>This field can then hold a maximum of ten characters. But if you only use 4 
  of them, the rest of the 10 characters will be blank spaces. The blank spaces 
  get added to the right of your text:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">&quot;TEXT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">&quot;TENLETTERS&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VARCHAR</h3>
<p>Like CHAR, but the rest of the characters are not padded with blank spaces. 
  The maximum value before MySQL 5.0.3 was 255. After this it's jumped to 65, 
  535. With VARCHAR, there is also an extra byte that records how long your text 
  is.</p>
<p>For our fields, then, we'll use the following Types:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>ID</b> SMALLINT<br>
  <b>First_Name</b> VARCHAR<br>
  <b>Surname</b> VARCHAR<br>
  <b>Address</b> TINYTEXT</p>
<p>So select these from your Types drop down list:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mysql11a.jpg" width="330" height="138" alt="Field Types" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">We've only set Lengths for the VARCHAR TYPES. If you leave it 
  blank for VARCHAR, you'll get a default value of 1 character.</p>
<p>The other Field settings we'll take a look at are these:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/mysql12.jpg" width="397" height="149" alt="Other Field Settings" border="1"> 
</div>
<p align="left"><b>Null</b><br>
  This is an important field in database terminology. It essentially means, &quot;Should 
  the field contain anything?&quot; If you set a field to NOT NULL, then you can't 
  leave it blank when you come to adding records to your database. Otherwise you'll 
  get errors.</p>
<p><b>Default</b><br>
  Do you want to add anything to the field, just in case it's left blank when 
  adding a record? If so, type it in here.</p>
<p><b>Extra</b><br>
  This is where you can set an auto increment value. This means adding one to 
  the previous record number. This is ideal for us, as we have an ID field. Then 
  we don't have to worry about this field. MySQL will take care of updating it 
  for us.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mysql13.jpg" width="83" height="30" alt="Field Icons" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">The three icons are Primary Key, Index, and Unique. Primary keys 
  are not terribly important for flat-file databases like ours. But they are important 
  when you have more than one table, and want to link information. They are set 
  to unique values, like our ID field. An index is useful for sorting information 
  in your tables, as they speed things up. Unique is useful for those fields when 
  there can't be any duplicate values.</p>
<p>So, set a primary key for the ID field by selecting the radio button, and choose 
  Auto Increment from the Extra drop down list:</p>
<P align="center"><img src="images/mysql14.jpg" width="395" height="147" alt="The auto_increment setting" border="1"> 
</P>
<p align="left">Your field screen then, minus the parts we've ignored, should 
  look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mysql15.jpg" width="430" height="184" alt="Field Settings" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">Bear in mind what we've done here: we've just set up the fields 
  for our table, and specified the kind of information that will be going into 
  each field (the columns). We haven't yet added any information to the table.</p>
<p>Click the Save button on the fields screen. You'll be taken back to the Structure 
  screen. There should be a lot more information there now. Don't worry if it 
  looks a bit confusing. All we want to do is to add one record to the table. 
  We'll then use PHP code to add some more.</p>
<P>In the next part, you'll learn how to add a record to your database table.
