  <p><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Foruml tutorial. The first part is here: 
    <a href="php16p1.html">Build your own Forum</a>, along with all the files 
    you need.</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So far, the databases you have been constructing have been fairly simple. 
    They only consisted of one or two tables, and there wasn't much linking done 
    between each table. For this fourm project, we'll need a more complex database. 
    And lots of tables!</p>
  <p>To see what the database looks like, enter this address in your browser. 
  </p>
  <p align="center"><b>http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/</b><br>
  </p>
  <p>This will open the <b>phpMyAdmin</b> page. On the left hand side, click the 
    drop down list for Databases. If you have copied the dbforum database over 
    to the data folder correctly, you should see it on the list:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/forum6.jpg" width="195" height="314" alt="The phpMyAdmin page" border="1"></p>
  <p>Select <b>dbforum</b> from the list and you should see the tables in the 
    database displayed. (If you can't see dbforum, you may not have copied the 
    database over to your <a href="php16p1.html">mysql/data folder</a> correctly.)</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/forum7.jpg" width="190" height="290" alt="The Tables in the dbforum Databse" border="1"></p>
  <p>In this database, there are a massive 12 tables! But why so many?</p>
  <p>The reason why there are so many tables is because we want to access the 
    information in the database as quickly as possible. You can get a real speed 
    boost by keeping data in different tables, rather than lumping all the information 
    into one or two tables. For example, we could have had one table to hold all 
    the information about the Microsoft Word section. We could have had columns 
    for the Posts, and columns for the replies. But this would mean that the one 
    table would be holding a lot of information: the text for the post, and the 
    text for the replies. It's much better (for coding and for speed) to keep 
    posts and replies in separate tables.</p>
  <p>(When working on larger web projects, taking the time to plan your database, 
    and all the tables you'll need, will pay dividends. One thing you don't want 
    to do is get half way through your coding only to discover that your database 
    isn't structured correctly, and that you're going to need another table, or 
    extra columns.)</p>
  <p>As well as 10 tables for the posts and replies there is a separate table 
    for the forum sections, and a separate table for member information. Let's 
    take a look at the <b>forumsections</b> table first:.</p>
