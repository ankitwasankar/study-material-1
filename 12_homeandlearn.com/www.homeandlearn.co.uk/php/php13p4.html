<P>You can use a HTML form to query your databases. But there are special security 
  considerations you need to bear in mind. We'll look at those issues in this 
  section. </P>
<p><br>
  If you use things like text boxes and text areas on your forms, you need to 
  take care. This is because of an attacks like SQL injection. Things like single 
  quotes need to be escaped. But you can use an inbuilt PHP function for this: 
</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">mysql_real_escape_string( )</p>
<p>We'll see how this works in a moment, but let's get some practical work done. 
  There is a file amongst the <a href="../downloads.html">ones you downloaded</a> 
  called <b>magicTest.php</b> (in the scripts folder). Load this script in your 
  browser, with your server running. You should see a text box and a button. Typed 
  the following name into the text box:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">O'Connor</p>
<p>Now click the button. You should see the name printed exactly as it is in the 
  text box. </p>
<p>So far, so good. Now, try this.</p>
<p>When you installed your server, there will be a file called <b>php.ini</b>. 
  This is a list of all the various settings to do with PHP itself. Locate this 
  file called php.ini (in the folder called <b>apache</b>, or do a search for 
  it). Open it up in a text editor. Search for this line:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">magic_quotes_gpc = Off</p>
<p>Change the Off to On, if it's not already on. Then save the changes.</p>
<p>Now load up the your PHP script with the text box and the button. With O'Connor 
  still in the text box, click your button again. You should see this printed:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">O \' Connor</p>
<p>So PHP has put a backslash before the single quote. But what's going on?</p>
<p>Characters like single and double quotes can be very dangerous, if you're running 
  SQL on your databases tables. These characters can be used to launch a SQL injection 
  attack. So the makers of PHP came up with a function called <b>magic_quotes_gpc</b>. 
  If this is set to On, then PHP will add the backslash to all single and double 
  quotes. That way, an attacker's life is made more difficult. As an example, 
  we'll load up a database and a script. These are already prepared for you.</p>
<p>Amongst the <a href="../downloads.html">files you downloaded</a> there is a 
  folder called <b>databases</b>. Inside this folder there is a one called <b>membertest</b>. 
  Save the entire membertest folder to your <b>data</b> directory in your mysql 
  data folder. For Wampserver users this will be at: </p>
<p align="center"><b>C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data</b></p>
<p>(If you have an earlier or later version, the number will be different.)<br>
</p>
<p>Now set <b>magic_quotes_gpc = On</b> back to <b>magic_quotes_gpc = Off </b>in 
  your <b>php.ini </b>file.</p>
<p>Along with the database folder there is a PHP script called <b>magicTest2.php</b> 
  (in the scripts folder). We'll use this script, and the database, to teach you 
  about SQL injection. Not so that you can launch your own attacks, of course! 
  It's so that you can thwart them.</p>
