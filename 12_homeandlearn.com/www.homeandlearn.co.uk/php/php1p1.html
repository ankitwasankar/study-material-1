<p>PHP is probably the most popular scripting language on the web. It is used 
  to enhance web pages. With PHP, you can do things like create username and password 
  login pages, check details from a form, create forums, picture galleries, surveys, 
  and a whole lot more. If you've come across a web page that ends in PHP, then 
  the author has written some programming code to liven up the plain, old HTML.</p>
<p>PHP is known as a server-sided language. That's because the PHP doesn't get 
  executed on your computer, but on the computer you requested the page from. 
  The results are then handed over to you, and displayed in your browser. Other 
  scripting languages you may have heard of are ASP, Python and Perl. (You don't 
  need to know any of these to make a start on PHP. In fact, these tutorials assume 
  that you have no programming experience at all.)</p>
<p>The most popular explanation of just what PHP stands for is &quot;Hypertext 
  Pre-processor&quot;. But that would make it HPP, surely? An alternative explanation 
  is that the initials come from the earliest version of the program, which was 
  called Personal Home Page Tools. At least you get the letters &quot;PHP&quot; 
  in the right order!</p>
<p>But PHP is so popular that if you're looking for a career in the web design/web 
  scripting industry then you just have to know it! In these tutorials, we'll 
  get you up and running. And, hopefully, it will be a lot easier than you think.</p>
<h3><br>
  Course Files</h3>
<p>To follow along with these tutorials, you'll need our Home and Learn Course 
  files. These can be downloaded from the following address:</p>

<p>You'll also need to have a server, to test your scripts. Don't worry, though 
  - we've found an easy way to get a server up and running on your own PC. Move 
  on to the next part to learn more.</p>
