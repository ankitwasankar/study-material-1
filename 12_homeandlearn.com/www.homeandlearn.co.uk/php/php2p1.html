<P>A variable is just a storage area. You put things into your storage areas (variables) 
  so that you can use and manipulate them in your programmes. Things you'll want 
  to store are numbers and text.</P>
<p>If you're ok with the idea of variables, then you can move on. If not, think 
  of them like this. Suppose you want to catalogue your clothing collection. You 
  enlist two people to help you, a man and a woman. These two people are going 
  to be your storage areas. They are going to hold things for you, while you tally 
  up what you own. The man and the woman, then, are variables.</p>
<p>You count how many coats you have, and then give these to the man. You count 
  how many shoes you have, and give these to the woman. Unfortunately, you have 
  a bad memory. The question is, which one of your people (variables) holds the 
  coats and which one holds the shoes? To help you remember, you can give your 
  people names! You could call them something like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">mr_coats<br>
  mrs_shoes</p>
<p>But it's entirely up to you what names you give your people (variables). If 
  you like, they could be called this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">man_coats<br>
  woman_shoes</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p class="indent_big">HimCoats<br>
  HerShoes</p>
<p>But because your memory is bad, it's best to give them names that help you 
  remember what it is they are holding for you. (There are some things your people 
  balk at being called. You can't begin their names with an underscore (_), or 
  a number. But most other characters are fine.)</p>
<p>OK, so your people (variables) now have name. But it's no good just giving 
  them a name. They are going to be doing some work for you, so you need to tell 
  them what they will be doing. The man is going to be holding the coats. But 
  we can specify how many coats he will be holding. If you have ten coats to give 
  him, then you do the &quot;telling&quot; like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">mr_coats = 10</p>
<p>So, the variable name comes first, then an equals sign. After the equals sign, 
  you tell your variable what it will be doing. Holding the number 10, in our 
  case. (The equals sign, by the way, is not really an equals sign. It's called 
  an assignment operator. But don't worry about it, at this stage. Just remember 
  that you need the equals sign to store things in your variables.)</p>
<p>However, you're learning PHP, so there's something missing. Two things, actually. 
  First, your people (variables) need a dollar sign at the beginning (people are 
  like that). So it would be this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>$</b>mr_coats = 10</p>
<p>If you miss the dollar sign out, then your people will refuse to work! But 
  the other thing missing is something really picky and fussy - a semi-colon. 
  Lines of code in PHP need a semi-colon at the end:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$mr_coats = 10<b>;</b></p>
<p>If you get any parse errors when you try to run your code, the first thing 
  to check is if you've missed the semi-colon off the end. It's very easy to do, 
  and can be frustrating. The next thing to check is if you've missed out a dollar 
  sign. But back to our people (variables).</p>
<p>So the man is holding ten coats. We can do the same thing with the other person 
  (variable):</p>
<p class="indent_big">$mrs_shoes = 25;</p>
<p>So, $mrs_shoes is holding a value of 25. If we then wanted to add up how many 
  items of clothes we have so far, we could set up a new variable (Note the dollar 
  sign at the begining of the new variable):</p>
<p class="indent_big">$total_clothes</p>
<p>We can then add up the coats and the shoes. You add up in PHP like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$total_clothes = $mr_coats + $mrs_shoes;</p>
<p>Remember, $mr_coats is holding a value of 10, and $mrs_shoes is holding a value 
  of 25. If you use a plus sign, PHP thinks you want to add up. So it will work 
  out the total for you. The answer will then get stored in our new variable, 
  the one we've called $total_clothes. You can also add up like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$total_clothes = 10 + 35;</p>
<p>Again, PHP will see the plus sign and add the two together for you. Of course, 
  you can add up more than two items:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$total_clothes = 10 + 35 + 7 + 38 + 1250;</p>
<p>But the idea is the same - PHP will see plus signs and then add things up. 
  The answer is then stored in your variable name, the one to the left of the 
  equals sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at how to put text into variables.</p>
