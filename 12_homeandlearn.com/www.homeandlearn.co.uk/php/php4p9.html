  <p>In the <a href="php4p1.html">previous sections</a>, you've been following 
    along and building up a HTML form. You've learned how to get the text from 
    a text box on a form, but there is a problem.</p>
  <p>When the b<b>asicForm.php</b> form is submitted, the details that the user 
    entered get erased. You're left with the VALUE that was set in the HTML. For 
    us, username kept appearing in the text box when the button was clicked. You 
    can keep the data the user entered quite easily.</p>
  <p>Your script should now look like the one in the link below. If not copy and 
    paste this script, and test it out on your server. (Save the script as <b>basicForm.php</b>.)</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="basicFormScript.htm" target="_blank">The basicForm.php 
    script</a></p>
</div>
<div class = leftMargin> 
  <p>If you look at the VALUE attribute of the text box in the HTML from the above 
    script, you'll see that it's set to &quot;<b>username</b>&quot;. Because the 
    form gets posted back to itself, this value will keep re-appearing in the 
    textbox when the page is submitted. Worse, if you've left the Value attributes 
    empty then everything the user entered will disappear. This can be very annoying, 
    if you're asking the user to try again. Better is to POST back the values 
    that the user entered.</p>
  <p>To post the details back to the form, and thus keep the data the user has 
    already typed out, you can use this:</p>
  <p class="TextIndent3">VALUE=&quot;&lt;?PHP print $username ; ?&gt;&quot;</p>
  <p>In other words, the VALUE attribute is now a PHP line of code. The line of 
    code is just this:</p>
  <p class="indent_big">&lt;?PHP</p>
  <p class="indent_bigger">print $username ;</p>
  <p class="indent_big">?&gt;</p>
  <p>It's a bit hard to read, because it's all on one line.</p>
  <p>You also need to amend your PHP code in the HEAD section to include an else 
    statement:</p>
  <p class="indent_small">if (isset($_POST['Submit1'])) {</p>
  <p class="indent_big">$username = $_POST['username'];</p>
  <p class="indent_big">if ($username == &quot;letmein&quot;) {</p>
  <p class="indent_bigger">print (&quot;Welcome back, friend!&quot;);</p>
  <p class="indent_big">}<br>
    else {</p>
  <p class="indent_bigger">print (&quot;You're not a member of this site&quot;);</p>
  <p class="indent_big">}</p>
  <p class="indent_small">}<br>
    else {</p>
  <p class="indent_big">$username =&quot;&quot;;</p>
  <p class="indent_small">}</p>
  <p> In the else statement at the end, we're just setting the value of the variable 
    called $username for when the button is NOT clicked, i.e. when the page is 
    refreshed.</p>
  <p>However, there are some security issues associated with textboxes (and other 
    form elements). So we'll see a more secure way to handle these in a later 
    section.</p>
  <p>But our new line of HTML for our textbox reads like this:</p>
  <p align="center">&lt;INPUT TYPE = 'TEXT' Name ='username' VALUE=&quot;<b>&lt;?PHP 
    print $username ; ?&gt;</b>&quot;&gt;</p>
  <p>In other words, we're now printing out the VALUE attribute with PHP code.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you know a few things about getting values from HTML forms, here's 
    a few exercise</p>
  <p><b>Exercise</b><br>
    Add two text boxes and a Submit button to a HTML form. Invite the user to 
    enter a first name and surname. When the button is clicked, print out the 
    person's full name. Don't worry about what is in the text boxes after the 
    button is clicked.</p>
  <p><b>Exercise</b><br>
    Using the same form as the previous exercise, display the first name and surname 
    in the textboxes, instead of printing them out.</p>
  <p><b>Exercise</b><br>
    Suppose your web site has only 5 users. Create a HTML form to check if a visitor 
    is one of the 5 users. Display a suitable message.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the next section, we'll take a look at how to handle Radion Buttons on 
    a HTML Form.</p>
