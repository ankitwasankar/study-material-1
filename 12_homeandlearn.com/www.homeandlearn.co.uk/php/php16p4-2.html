					<P><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Foruml tutorial. The first part 
          is here: <a href="php16p1-2.html">Build your own Forum</a>, along with 
          all the files you need. The previous lesson is <a href="php16p3-2.html">here</a>.</i></P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The members table, as its name suggests, holds information about people 
          who have joined the forum. Click the <b>members</b> table in <b>phpMyAdmin</b>, 
          then click <b>Browse</b> at the top. You should see the fields in the 
          table:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/forum11-2.jpg" width="479" height="153" alt="The fields in the members table" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">There are five columns in the members table: <b>memberID</b>, 
          <b>username</b>, <b>password</b>, <b>signupDate</b>, and <b>email</b>. 
          (The passwords, by the way, should be encrypted. For tutorial purposes, 
          however, we haven't done this. But you saw how to do this in an earlier 
          section.)</p>
        <p>The unique column (the primary key) is <b>memberID</b>. You'll see 
          this column in the other tables, as well. When you're displaying information 
          about a Post or a Reply, you'll want to include which member did the 
          posting or replying. If you match the memberID in, say, the <b>wpposts</b> 
          table with the memberID in the <b>members</b> table, you then have an 
          easy and efficient way to display the member information. The alternative 
          is to include a username column in the posts and replies table. But 
          this would be a really bad way to construct a database, because you'd 
          be duplicating information. With a single members table, and a reference 
          field in other tables, you don't need to add username fields into every 
          post and reply table. Just link to the members table.</p>
        <p>But the members table we have here is really basic. You could add more 
          fields. A common practice in Forums is to reward loyal members who Post 
          and Reply often with a higher status than other members. Its these members 
          who keep a Forum alive. Because they'll give up their spare time, it's 
          a good idea to give them a little control over the Forum, say as a moderator. 
          In the members table, then, you can add a Status field. This would allow 
          you to change what a member is allowed to do. </p>
        <p>Depending on what type of forum you want, you can add even more fields 
          to the members section. What about adding an Avatar field? This could 
          be a link to an small image that the member wanted to use in their Posts 
          and Replies. But we're sure that you can think of more fields that can 
          be added to our basic members table!</p>
        <p align="left">In the next part, we'll take a look at the 5 Post tables 
          in the database.</p>
