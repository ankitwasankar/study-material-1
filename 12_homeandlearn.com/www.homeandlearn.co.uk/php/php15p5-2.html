<p><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Survey/Poll tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="php15p1-2.html">Build your own Survey/Poll</a>, along with all 
  the files you need.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Vote button is clicked, the user will be sent to a new page. Behind 
  the scenes, you're recording the vote and adding it the database.</p>
<p>As well as adding the vote to the database, you'll probably want to implement 
  some sort of check to prevent people from voting over and over again. If you 
  open up the code for the <b>process.php</b> page (in the survey folder), you'll 
  see that the checking is done via a session variable. You met this code during 
  the username/password walkthrough.</p>
<p class="indent_small">session_start();<br>
  if ( (isset($_SESSION['hasVoted'])) ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">//Already Voted</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">//Process the Vote</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>(NOTE: Session variables work by sending you an ID as a cookie. If you have 
  cookies disabled then the session variable won't work, and you can vote over 
  and over again! You might want to check that cookies are enabled in the browser.)</p>
<p>So we start a session, and check if the session variable called hasVoted has 
  been set. If it has, then a vote from this user has already been added to the 
  database. In which case, a message is displayed.</p>
<p>If no session has been set, then the else part of the if statement is executed. 
  The first line of this is another if statement:</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ( isset($_GET['Submit1']) &amp;&amp; isset($_GET['q']) 
  ) {</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>Here's we're checking for two things: was the Submit button called Submit1 
  clicked on the previous page, and has the radio button data been handed over 
  to this page (the radio button data will be in the variable called 'q')? If 
  the answer to both questions is Yes then we can go ahead and process the data; 
  if the answer is No, then we can assume that the button was clicked but the 
  user didn't select a radio button. In which case, this message is displayed: 
  print &quot;You didn't selected a voting option!&quot;;</p>
<p>If all went OK, though, the first line of the new if statement to get executed 
  is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$selected_radio = $_GET['q'];</p>
<p>This just gets which radio button was clicked. The value comes from the HTML 
  form, and will be A, B or C. This is then placed into the variable called<b> 
  $selected_radio</b>.</p>
<p>The next few lines open a connection to the database, like we did before. After 
  the database has been successfully opened, we have this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$_SESSION['hasVoted'] = '1';</p>
<p>This is our &quot;hasVoted&quot; session variable, and we're placing a value 
  of &quot;1&quot; into it. If the user tries to vote again, a message of &quot;You've 
  already voted&quot; will be displayed. </p>
<p>The next line is where we add the record to the answers table in our database:</p>
<p class="indent_small">$SQL = &quot;UPDATE answers SET $selected_radio = $selected_radio 
  + 1&quot;;</p>
<p>Here, we're using the SQL command UPDATE. After the word UPDATE, you type the 
  name of the table you want to UPDATE (answers, for us). We only want to update 
  the field that was passed to the page in the &quot;q&quot; variable. This will 
  be either A, B or C, which are the column names from the answers table. We can 
  then use the SET keyword to set just that column from the table. Because the 
  variable called <b>$selected_radio</b> will contain only A, B or C we can just 
  add 1 to whatever is currently there:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">SET $selected_radio = $selected_radio + 1&quot;;</p>
<p>You'll notice that we're not making sure to move to the end of the records 
  in the answers table (which we should do), but trusting MySQL to do it for us. 
</p>
<p>This is not a good idea! In your own code, you should make sure that the correct 
  record is being updated. We're taking shortcuts for simplicity's sake.</p>
<p>After the table is updated, we close the connection to the database, and print 
  out a message: &quot;Thanks for voting&quot;.</p>
<p>And that's it - a vote has been added to the table.</p>
<p>You can add a &quot;back&quot; link to the HTML, or do anything else you like 
  with your page. Or perhaps you could add a link so that the results of the voting 
  can be viewed? We'll take a look at the code for the <b>results</b> page now.</p>
