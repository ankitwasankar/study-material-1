<P><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing Survey/Poll tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="php15p1-2.html">Build your own Survey/Poll</a>, along with all 
  the files you need.</i></P>
<p>On the <b>survey.php </b>page, there is a button that can be clicked to View 
  the Results. If this button is clicked, the user will see something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/survey9-2.jpg" width="345" height="189" alt="The results of the survey"></p>
<p>The red line represents how many people voted for a particular option. After 
  that, we have the number as a percentage, and what the option was.</p>
<p>On the previous page, survey.php, The HTML form was this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;FORM NAME =&quot;form2&quot; METHOD =&quot;GET&quot; 
  ACTION =&quot;viewResults.php&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;INPUT TYPE = &quot;Submit&quot; Name = &quot;Submit2&quot; 
  VALUE = &quot;View results&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE = &quot;Hidden&quot; Name = &quot;h1&quot; VALUE = &lt;?PHP print 
  $qID; ?&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
<p>The value in the variable <b>$qID</b>(part of the Hidden HTML form element) 
  is coming from the PHP code you saw earlier. This is the QID field that is in 
  both the questions and answers tables in our database. We need to pass this 
  QID number over to the <b>viewResults.php</b> page so that the correct results 
  can be displayed.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">If you open up the code for <b>viewResults.php</b> page (in the 
  survey folder), you'll see there's quite a lot there! But most of the code is 
  taken up with manipulating the <b>red.jpg</b> graphic! We're just stretching 
  a red line, depending on how many votes were cast for an option. The rest of 
  the code pulls the data from the table, and puts values into variables. We'll 
  keep the two separate, for explanation purposes.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">How many people voted for a particular option?</h3>
<p>To see how many people voted for A, B or C, we first have to get that value 
  from the <b>viewResults.php</b> page.</p>
<p class="indent_big">if (isset($_GET['Submit2'])) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">$qNum = $_GET['h1'];</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>First, we check to see if the Submit button was clicked on the previous page. 
  If it was then we can GET the hidden value:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$qNum = $_GET['h1'];</p>
<p>The Hidden form element had the NAME &quot;<b>h1</b>&quot;. It's this NAME 
  that goes between the square brackets of $_GET. The VALUE of the <b>h1</b> hidden 
  element is coming from the <b>$qID</b> variable. This will be the QID field 
  in the database tables tblQuestions and answers. We can use this value to pull 
  records from the tables, which the next two lines do:</p>
<P class="TextIndent2">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tblquestions, answers WHERE 
  tblquestions.QID = answers.QID AND answers.QID = '$qNum'&quot;;</P>
<p class="TextIndent2">$result = mysql_query($SQL);</p>
<p>Here, we're selecting all the records from two tables:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">SELECT * FROM tblquestions, answers</p>
<p>But we need a WHERE part. The WHERE clause is quite tricky:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">WHERE tblquestions.QID = answers.QID AND answers.QID = 
  '$qNum'</p>
<p>To match the two QID fields, we have this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">tblquestions.QID = answers.QID</p>
<p>The name of the table goes first, followed by a dot. After the dot, we've typed 
  the QID field. This is present in both tables.</p>
<p>But we only need the records where the QID field matches the qNum that was 
  handed over from the previous page:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">AND answers.QID = '$qNum'</p>
<p>We're saying &quot;Only bring back the records where the two QID fields match 
  AND where the QID value in the answers table is equal to the value in the variable 
  called $qNum&quot;. A bit more complex, but go over it a few times and it will 
  make sense. Hopefully!</p>
<p>After the SQL has been run, we put the results into an array:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$db_field = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);</p>
<P class="TextIndent3">$question = $db_field['Question'];<br>
  $answerA = $db_field['A'];<br>
  $answerB = $db_field['B'];<br>
  $answerC = $db_field['C'];</P>
<p class="TextIndent3">$qA = $db_field['qA'];<br>
  $qB = $db_field['qB'];<br>
  $qC = $db_field['qC'];</p>
<P>If you look at the values in the square brackets, you'll see that they are 
  the field names from both tables. We're getting the value for the Question, 
  the answers A, B and C, as well as the original options for each questions (qA, 
  qB and qC). All of these values are then placed into variables, ready for displaying 
  on the page.</P>
<p>We could just print the values to the page, like this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print $question;<br>
  print $answerA;<br>
  print $answerB;<br>
  print $answerC;</p>
<p>But that's not very interesting for the viewer. Better is some form of graphic, 
  like the one at the top of this page. This is what you'll see when you click 
  the button to View the Results. Here's how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Display a graphic for the results</h3>
<p>At the top of the code, you'll notice some variables are set up:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$imgTagA = '';<br>
  $imgWidthA = '0';</P>
<p class="TextIndent3">$imgTagB = '';<br>
  $imgWidthB = '0';</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$imgTagC = '';<br>
  $imgWidthC = '0';</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$imgHeight = '10';<br>
  $totalP = '';<br>
  $percentA = '0';<br>
  $percentB = '0';<br>
  $percentC = '0';</p>
<p>What we're going to do here is to manipulate the HTML IMG tag. This tag is 
  used to display an image, and ordinarily would look something line this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">&lt;IMG SRC = 'red.jpg' HEIGHT = '10' <font color="#0000FF">WIDTH</font> 
  = '100'&gt;</p>
<p>The part we want to manipulate with our PHP code is the WIDTH value. Instead 
  of setting it to a fixed value, we can set it to a value from the answers table. 
</p>
<p>In the answers table, the columns for A, B and C hold how many people voted 
  for a particular option. We have three separate IMG tags in our code, one for 
  each of the columns. If, for example, A held a value of 45 (meaning 45 people 
  voted for this option), we can make the WIDTH of the red line image 45 pixels.</p>
<p>Except, 45 pixels is not very wide. Much better to turn them all in to percentages. 
  Which is what the following code does:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$totalP = $answerA + $answerB + $answerC;</p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">$percentA = (($answerA * 100) / $totalP);</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">$percentA = floor($percentA);</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">$percentB = (($answerB * 100) / $totalP);</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">$percentB = floor($percentB);</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">$percentC = (($answerC * 100) / $totalP);</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">$percentC = floor($percentC);</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">$imgWidthA = $percentA * 2;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">$imgWidthB = $percentB * 2;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">$imgWidthC = $percentC * 2;</span></b></p>
<p>First you need to total up how many people voted:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$totalP = $answerA + $answerB + $answerC;</p>
<p>Next, you can multiply A, B and C by 100 and then divide by the total:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$percentA = (($answerA * 100) / $totalP);</p>
<p>Because this would give an answer like 24.567, we can use the inbuilt Math 
  function floor to strip the &quot;point something&quot; at the end:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$percentA = floor($percentA);</p>
<p>Finally, you can multiply by, say, 2 to give the red line some extra width:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$imgWidthA = $percentA * 2;</p>
<p>The values in $imgWidthA, $imgWidthB and $imgWidthC can then be used to build 
  an IMG tag:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">$imgTagA = &quot;&lt;IMG SRC = 'red.jpg' Height = &quot; 
  . $imgHeight . &quot; WIDTH = &quot; . $imgWidthA . &quot;&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p>To display this on the page, we use the following:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">print $imgTagA . &quot; &quot; . $percentA . &quot;% &quot; 
  . $qA . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p>So the red line gets displayed first, followed by the percentage of people 
  who voted for this option. A percent sign and the option itself complete the 
  line.</p>
<p>And that completes the survey walkthrough. Feel free to adapt and amend the 
  code you downloaded. But don't forget to make a backup of the original files!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, we'll take a look at how to build your own online Forum.</p>
