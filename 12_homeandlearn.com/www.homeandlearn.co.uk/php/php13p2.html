<P>To read records from a database, the technique is usually to loop round and 
  find the ones you want. To specify which records you want, you use something 
  called SQL. This stands for Structured Query Language. This is a natural, non-coding 
  language that uses words like SELECT and WHERE. At it's simplest level, it's 
  fairly straightforward. But the more complex the database, the more trickier 
  the SQL is. We'll start with something simple though.</P>
<p>What we want to do, now that we have a connection to our database, is to read 
  all the records, and print them out to the page. Here's some new code, added 
  to <a href="php13p1.html">the PHP script you already have</a>. The new lines 
  are in blue:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">&lt;?PHP</p>
<p class="indent_small">$user_name = &quot;root&quot;;<br>
  $password = &quot;&quot;;<br>
  $database = &quot;addressbook&quot;;<br>
  $server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_small">$db_handle = mysql_connect($server, $user_name, $password);<br>
  $db_found = mysql_select_db($database, $db_handle);</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ($db_found) {</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tb_address_book&quot;;<br>
  $result = mysql_query($SQL);</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">while ( $db_field = mysql_fetch_assoc($result) ) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger_blue">print $db_field['ID'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['First_Name'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Surname'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Address'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">}</p>
<p class="indent_big">mysql_close($db_handle);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print &quot;Database NOT Found &quot;;<br>
  mysql_close($db_handle);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">?&gt;</p>
<p>Before we go through the new code to see what's happening, run your script. 
  You should find that the address you added in <a href="php12p4.html">a previous 
  section</a> is printed out. (We only have one record at the moment.)</p>
<p class="indent_big">1<br>
  Test<br>
  Name<br>
  12 Test Street</p>
<p>The first line in the new code is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tb_address_book&quot;;</p>
<p>The $SQL is just a normal variable. But we're putting into it a long string. 
  This is a SQL statement. Here's a brief run down on SQL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Structured Query Language</h3>
<p>SQL (pronounced SEEKwel), is a way to query and manipulate databases. The basics 
  are quite easy to learn. If you want to grab all of the records from a table 
  in a database, you use the <b>SELECT</b> word. Like this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">SELECT * FROM Table_Name</p>
<p>SQL is not case sensitive, so the above line could be written:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">Select * From Table_Name</p>
<p>But your SQL statements are easier to read if you type the keywords in uppercase 
  letters. The keywords in the lines above are <b>SELECT</b> and <b>FROM</b>. 
  The asterisk (*) means &quot;All Records&quot;. <b>Table_Name</b> is the name 
  of a table in your database. So the whole line reads:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">&quot;SELECT all the records FROM the table called Table_Name&quot;</p>
<p>You don&#146;t have to select all the records from your database. You can just 
  select the columns that you need. For example, if we wanted to select just the 
  first name and surname columns from this table, we can specify that in our SQL 
  String:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">&quot;SELECT First_Name, Surname FROM tb_address_book&quot;;</p>
<p>When this SQL statement is executed, only the <b>First_Name</b> and <b>Surname</b> 
  columns from the database will be returned.</p>
<p>There are a lot more SQL commands to get used to, and you'll meet more of them 
  as you go along. For now, we're just selecting all the records from our table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Back to the Code</h4>
<p>The first line of our code, then, was this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tb_address_book&quot;;</p>
<p>SO we have a SQL statement, but we need to pass it to another inbuilt function: 
</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">mysql_query( )</p>
<p>The <b>mysql_query</b>( ) function is used to send a SQL query to your database. 
  If you have typed out your SQL correctly, then the function will return a value. 
  This value will be true, false, or a file handle. Because we're using the <b>SELECT</b> 
  keyword, the value returned by will be a file handle. In our code, the line 
  was this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$result = <b>mysql_query(</b> $SQL <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>The file handle returned in our <b>$result</b> variable just points to the 
  results. It doesn't actually bring anything back. To bring back the data, we 
  had this inside a while loop:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">$db_field = <b>mysql_fetch_assoc(</b> $result <b>)</b>;</p>
<p>The inbuilt function we're using to bring results back is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>mysql_fetch_assoc(</b> $result <b>)</b></p>
<p>The <b>assoc</b> part means Associative. As in &quot;associative array&quot;. 
  So we're asking that the results be brought back in an array format. In between 
  the round brackets of <b>mysql_fetch_assoc</b> we have typed the name of our 
  file handle &#150; the one that was pointing to the results of SQL statement.</p>
<p>Remember: an associative array is one where the keys are text. So it's this 
  format:</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">Array['One'] = <br>
  Array['Two'] =<br>
  Array['Three]' =</p>
<p>And not this:</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">Array[1] = <br>
  Array[2] =<br>
  Array[3] =</p>
<p>When the <b>mysql_fetch_assoc</b> function returns an array, we're putting 
  it all into a variable called <b>$db_field</b>. The Key part of the array is 
  all the Column names from our database tables. This is done automatically for 
  you. So the array format will be this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>$db_field[</b>Column_Name<b>]</b> = <b>Value</b></p>
<p>The reason why you're doing this is so that you can loop round the array and 
  access the values from the table. Here's our loop, without anything between 
  the round brackets:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">while ( ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print $db_field['ID'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['First_Name'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Surname'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Address'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">}</p>
<p>So we're printing whatever the value is in the array position <b>$db_field['</b>ID<b>'],</b> 
  <b>$db_field['</b>First_Name<b>']</b>, <b>$db_field['</b>Surname<b>']</b> and 
  <b>$db_field['</b>Address<b>']</b>. We're also adding a HTML line break at the 
  end, just for printing purposes.</p>
<p>If all that is confusing, just remember the format:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>Array_Name[</b>Table_Coulmn_Name<b>]</b> = <b>Value_From_Record</b></p>
<p>Our whole while loop, then, is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">while ($db_field = mysql_fetch_assoc($result) ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print $db_field['ID'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['First_Name'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Surname'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Address'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">}</p>
<p>Because that is a bit complex, let's go through the steps we've used to access 
  the records from our table:</p>
<OL>
  <LI>Set up a SQL Statement that can be used to get the records from the database 
    table</LI>
  <LI>Use mysql_query() to bring back the records we've specified in Step 1</LI>
  <LI>Use mysql_fetch_assoc() to set up an array. The array will contain all the 
    records that were returned in Step 2</LI>
  <LI>Loop round all the data in the array using a While loop</LI>
</OL>
<p>Step 1 was this, in the code: </p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM tb_address_book&quot;;</p>
<p>Step 2 was this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$result = mysql_query($SQL);</p>
<p>Step 3 was this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$db_field = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)</p>
<p>And Step 4 was this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">while ($db_field = mysql_fetch_assoc($result) ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">print $db_field['ID'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['First_Name'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Surname'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;<br>
  print $db_field['Address'] . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p class="TextIndent1">}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're still confused, study the code and go over this section. In the next 
  section, we'll adapt the code to add more records to our database table.</p>
