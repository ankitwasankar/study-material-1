</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>(This lessons follows on from <a href="php13p4-2.html">the previous one</a>.)</P>
<p>When you open the <b>magicTest2.php</b> page in your browser, you'll see three 
  textboxes: one for a username, one for a password, and one for an email address. 
  There is also a button on the form.</p>
<p>Enter the following in the email address text box:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3"><b>test1@test1.com</b></p>
<p>Click the button, and you should see following print out:</p>
<p class="indent_big">1<br>
  test1<br>
  test1<br>
  test1@test1.com</p>
<p>These correspond to the four fields in the database. The four fields are:</p>
<p class="indent_big">ID<br>
  username<br>
  password<br>
  email</p>
<p>So the username is <b>test1</b>, the password is <b>test1</b>, and the email 
  address is <b>test1@test1.com</b>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose you were na&iuml;ve enough to have a database table exactly like 
  that one. An attacker will test to see if any syntax error messages can be returned. 
  If so, this means that the author of the script has not dealt with single/double 
  quotes correctly. The attacker can then go ahead with further probes.</p>
<p>Try your script again. Only this time, add a single quote to the end of the 
  test email address in the textbox:</p>
<p class="indent_big">test1@test1.com'</p>
<p>Now click the Submit button. What you should find is that an error message 
  is indeed returned. Something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Warning: mysql_fetch_assoc(): supplied argument is not a 
  valid MySQL result resource</b></p>
<p>Because Magic Quotes are off, that single quote is not being escaped. The line 
  in our new script that is doing the damage is the one:<br>
</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM members WHERE email = '$email' 
  &quot;;</p>
<p>The SQL this time has a <b>WHERE</b> clause added. The WHERE clause is used 
  when you want to limit the results to only records that you need. After the 
  word &quot;WHERE&quot;, you type a column name from your database (<b>email</b>, 
  in our case). You then have an equals sign, followed by the value you want to 
  check. The value we want to check is coming from the variable called <b>$email</b>. 
  This is surrounded with single quotes. </p>
<p>When an email address is entered in the text box on our form, this value goes 
  straight into the variable without any checks. When you type that extra single 
  quote on the end, that will be added to the SQL. This is then run on the database. 
  Because it's a stray single quote, you'll get a syntax error. It's this syntax 
  error that an attacker is looking for.</p>
<p>Next, the attacker will try to add some SQL to yours. Try this. In the email 
  address textbox, type the following. Type it exactly as it is, with the single 
  quotes:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">hi' OR 'x'='x</p>
<p>When you click the Submit button, you should find that there are no errors, 
  and that the username, password and email address are printed out!</p>
<p>The attacker is trying to find out whether or not the SQL can be manipulated. 
  If the answer is yes, further attacks will be launched. Can the table and field 
  names be guessed? Can a username and password be guessed? It's this kind of 
  attack that you want to thwart.</p>
<p>Try this last one. Enter the following into the email address box:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">' OR ''='</p>
<p>Now click Submit.</p>
<p>Again, the details are printed out. This is because an <b>OR</b> clause has 
  been added. The OR clause is set to a blank string. Meaning that the records 
  will be brought back if it's a valid email address or not!</p>
<p>To stop this kind of attack, you MUST use some inbuilt PHP functions. The one 
  to use for this kind of attack is:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">mysql_real_escape_string( )</p>
<p>Between the round brackets, you type the string you need to check, followed 
  by an optional database handle. To test this out, there is another script like 
  the one you've just tried. This one is called <b>magicTest3.php</b> (in the 
  same scripts folder). If you open this up in your text editor, you should see 
  this added to the code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">$email = mysql_real_escape_string($email, $db_handle);</p>
<p>Now, the $email variable is being checked for any of the following:</p>
<p align="center"><b>\x00<br>
  \n<br>
  \r<br>
  \<br>
  '<br>
  &quot;<br>
  \x1a</b></p>
<p>If any of the above characters are found, a backslash is added. Try the new 
  script. Enter the following in the email address text box (with the single quote 
  on the end):</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">test1@test1.com'</p>
<p>What you should find is that the following gets returned:</p>
<p class="TextIndent3">test1@test1.com\'</p>
<p>So the single quote has had a backslash added to it. The point is that the 
  dangerous SQL doesn't get executed. Try the above attacks again. This time, 
  you shouldn't be able to get in, if any of the listed escape characters have 
  been used.</p>
<p>But you need to use the function on all variables or data that will be used 
  in your SQL. So you should do this kind of thing:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$username = mysql_real_escape_string($username, $db_handle);<br>
  $password = mysql_real_escape_string($password, $db_handle);<br>
  $email = mysql_real_escape_string($email, $db_handle);</p>
<p>Examine the code in the new script. Pay attention to where the new lines go: 
  after you have opened a connection to your database. </p>
<p>The PHP manual recommends the following sample script, when working with SQL 
  (all comments are theirs; bold and colour is ours):</p>
<p align="center"><a href="quoteSmart-2.htm" target="_blank">The PHP manual script</a></p>
<p>We have adapted the <b>magicTest3</b> script, with the recommended code added, 
  so that you can see it in action. The new script is <a href="../downloads-2.html">magicTest4.php</a>. 
  Open the script and study the code. See if you can figure out how the new additions 
  work.</p>
<p>As well as using mysql_real_escape_string( ), you'll need to use the other 
  function you saw earlier, in the forms section - <b>htmlspecialchars</b>().</p>
<p>It can be a lot of work, dealing with SQL injection attacks, and handling all 
  those escape characters. But if you don't want your databases attacked, you 
  HAVE to defend yourself!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Limit the charcters that a user can enter</h3>
<p>Another security technique that some advocate is to limit the characters that 
  can be entered. For example, you might have this in your script:</p>
<p class="indent_big">$valid_chars = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;;<br>
  $valid_nums = &quot;1234567890&quot;;<br>
  $valid_other = &quot;&pound;$^&amp;_@#~&quot;;</p>
<p>You can then use some Conditional Logic to test if the character the user entered 
  was on your list. If it's not, then you can display an error message.</p>
