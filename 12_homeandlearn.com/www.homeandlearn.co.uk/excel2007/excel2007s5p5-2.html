        <h2 align="center">Financial Functions</h2>
        <p align="left">The financial function we're going to explore is called 
          PMT( ). You use this function when you want to calculate things like 
          the monthly payment amounts on a loan, or how much per month a mortgage 
          will cost you. We'll use it to work out how much per month a loan will 
          cost us. Here's what we'll do.</p>
        <p>We've decided to take out a loan of ten thousand pounds from our friendly 
          banker. We're going to be paying it back over 5 years. The question 
          is, how much per month is this going to cost us?<br>

        <h3 align="left">The PMT( ) Function in Excel</h3>
        <p>The PMT( ) function expects certain values in between its two round 
          brackets. The values that go in round brackets are known as arguments. 
          The arguments for the PMT( ) function are these:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>PMT(</b>rate, nper, pv, fv, type<b>)</b></p>
        <p>Only the first three are needed, and you can miss the final two out, 
          if you like.</p>
        <p>We'll work out our monthly loan costs with the help of the PMT( ) function. 
          First, create a new spreadsheet like the one below:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><img src="images/2pmt-2.gif" width="631" height="121" alt="Excel 2007 Spreadsheet"></p>
        <p align="left">If you look at cell B1 on the spreadsheet, you'll see 
          a figure of &pound;10, 000. This is the amount we want to borrow. The 
          labels on Row 3 show what else we need: An interest rate, the number 
          of payments we'll make over the 5 years, the present value of the loan, 
          the amount we'll have to pay back each month, and the total amount paid 
          back after 5 years. But we only need the first three for our PMT() function.</p>
        <p>In cell A4, we'll need an interest rate. In cell B4 we'll need the 
          number of payments, and in cell D4 we'll need the Present Value of the 
          loan. First is interest rate.</p>
        <p>Imagine that the interest rate given to us by the bank is 24 percent 
          per year. For the PMT( ) function, we need to divide this figure by 
          12 (the number of months in a year) So try this:<br>
        </p>
        <UL>
          <LI>Click into cell A4 on your spreadsheet</LI>
          <LI>Enter the following formula:</LI>
        </UL>
        <div align="center"><b>= 24% / 12 </b> </div>
        <UL>
          <LI>Hit the enter key to see the answer appear, as in the image below:</LI>
        </UL>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2pmt2-2.gif" width="456" height="145" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">Now that we have an interest rate, the next thing we need 
          for the PMT( ) function is how many payments there are in total. We 
          have to pay something back every month for 5 years. Which is a simple 
          formula. So,</p>
        <UL>
          <LI>Click into B4 on your spreadsheet and enter the following:</LI>
        </UL>
        <div align="center"><b>= 12 * 5 </b> </div>
        <UL>
          <LI>Hit the enter key to see a figure of 60 as the answer.</LI>
        </UL>
        <p align="left">This figure of 60 is for the second argument of the PMT( 
          ) function - the <b>nper</b>. This is just the number of payments. </p>
        <p>Now that you have a figure in cell A4 (<b>rate</b>), and a figure in 
          cell B4 (<b>nper</b>), there's only one more to go - the Present Value 
          (<b>pv</b>).</p>
        <p>The Present Value of a loan, also known as the Principal, is what the 
          loan is worth at the present time. Since we haven't made any payments 
          yet, this is just 10, 000 for us. <br>
        </p>
        <UL>
          <LI>Click into cell C4 on your spreadsheet and enter the following:</LI>
        </UL>
        <div align="center"><b>= B1 </b> </div>
        <UL>
          <LI>Hit the enter key</LI>
          <LI>You'll see a figure of 10, 000 appear, and your spreadsheet should 
            now look ours below:</LI>
        </UL>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2pmt3-2.gif" width="568" height="140" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">OK, we now have all the parts for our PMT() function: 
          a rate (A4), an nper (B4), and a pv (C4). Try this:</p>
        <UL>
          <LI>Click into cell D4 on your spreadsheet</LI>
          <LI>Enter the following function:</LI>
        </UL>
        <div align="center"><b>=PMT(A4, B4, C4) </b> </div>
        <p>Hit the enter key on your keyboard, and you'll see the monthly amount 
          appear. The figure you should have is -&pound;287.68. The reason there 
          is a minus sign before the total is because it's a debt: what you owe 
          to the bank.</p>
        <p>But this is what your spreadsheet should look like:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2pmt4-2.gif" width="568" height="165" border="1" alt="The montly payment amount"></p>
        <p align="left">The only thing left to do is see how much this loan will 
          cost us at the end of 5 years. All you need to do here is multiply the 
          monthly amount in cell D4 by the number of payments in cell B4. Enter 
          your formula for this in cell E4, and you spreadsheet will look like 
          ours below:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2pmt5-2.gif" width="568" height="119" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">So a ten thousand pounds loan, at the interest rate the 
          bank is offering, means we'll have to pay back just over 17 thousand 
          pounds over 5 years.</p>
                       <p align="center">

        <h3 align="left">Tweaking the Values</h3>
        <p>We can change the spreadsheet slightly to give us more control. For 
          your figure in cell B4, the number of payments, you entered 12 * 5. 
          This is 12 months multiplied by 5 years. But what if we wanted to pay 
          the loan back over 10 years, or 15? How much will our monthly payments 
          then be? And will be the final cost of the loan?</p>
        <p>Also, the interest rate seems a bit high. What if we can get a better 
          rate elsewhere? </p>
        <p>By making a few changes to or spreadsheet, we can amend these values 
          more easily. First we'll need two new rows.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 align="left">Inserting New Rows in Excel</h3>
        <p>We need to insert new rows in our spreadsheet. To insert a new row, 
          click into cell A2. Then click on the <b>Home</b> tab at the top of 
          Excel. Locate the <b>Cells</b> panel, and click the <b>Insert</b> item:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2InsertCellsPanel-2.gif" width="130" height="85" alt="The Cells panel in Excel 2007"></p>
        <p align="left">From the Insert menu, click on <b>Insert Sheet Rows</b>:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2InsertCellsPanel2-2.gif" width="168" height="162" alt="Insert a new row"></p>
        <p align="left">Excel will insert a new row for you. Do this again to 
          get two blank rows. Add two new labels, <b>Num of Years</b> and <b>Interest</b>. 
          Your spreadsheet sheet will then look like this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2pmt6-2.gif" width="568" height="160" alt="Two new rows have been inserted"></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 align="left">Adapting the PMT Formula</h3>
        <p>We can adapt the formulas we've entered so far, in order to make them 
          more usable. As an example, we'll adapt the interest rate. </p>
        <p>To get the interest rate for cell A4, we entered a formula:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= 24% / 12</b></p>
        <p>Instead of having the interest rate in cell A4, however, we can place 
          it at the top, in cell B3 on our new Row. We can then alter the interest 
          rate by simply typing a new one in cell B3. To clear all that up, try 
          the following:</p>
        <UL>
          <LI>Click inside cell B3, which is the Interest cell in the image above</LI>
          <LI>Click inside the formula bar</LI>
          <LI>Type in = 24%</LI>
          <LI>Cell B3 should now read 24.00% (In Excel 2010 you may have to format 
            the cell to a Percentage value from the Home tab then the Numer item.)</LI>
        </UL>
        To change the formula for your interest rate click inside of cell A6. 
        Change the formula from this: 
        <p align="center"><b>= 24% / 12</b></p>
        <p>to this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= B3 / 12</b></p>
        <p>Hit the enter key on your keyboard and nothing should change on your 
          spreadsheet. But the difference is that you can enter a new interest 
          rate in cell B3, and see how this effects the loan amounts. Try it out 
          by typing 23% in cell B3:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2pmt7-2.gif" width="568" height="185" border="1"></p>
        <p align="left">As you can see, the interest rate has changed to a rather 
          long figure. But notice the Monthly Amount - it has gone down to &pound;281.90. 
          The total amount we have to pay back has changed, too. Play around with 
          the interest rate in cell B3, just to get a feel for how it works.</p>
                        <p align="center">
