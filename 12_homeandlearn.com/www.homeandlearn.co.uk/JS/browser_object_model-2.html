</HEADER><SECTION> 
<P>All browsers are split into different parts (objects) that can be accessed 
  using Javascript. Collectively, these parts are known as the Browser Object 
  Model, or the BOM. At the very top of this browser hierarchy is the Window object. 
  This represents the entire browser, with its toolbars, menus, status bar, the 
  page itself, and a whole lot more besides. Effectively, the Window IS the browser.</P>
  <P align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* js_top */
google_ad_slot = "5820968310";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script></P>
<P>Underneath the Window Object there are lots of other objects you can access. 
  These allow you do things like, redirecting the user to a different web page, 
  get the size of the browser window, access all the HTML elements on the page 
  and, again, a whole lot more besides. Here's an (incomplete) list of Window 
  objects. Notice that the two objects are separated by a dot (full stop/period), 
  with no space between the two.</P>
<P><b>window.document</b><br>
  Allows you to access all your HTML elements. We'll go into more detail about 
  the document object later.<br>
</P>
<P><b>window.history</b><br>
  Access information about browsing history. This object is of limited use since 
  you can't get at which pages a user has visited, just how many pages are in 
  the browsing history. You can also access the methods history.back, history.forward 
  and history.go. There's not many situations where you want to, though.<br>
</P>
<P><b>window.innerHeight </b>and <b>window.innerWidth</b><br>
  Gets the height and width of the available space on the page<br>
</P>
<P><b>window.screen </b><br>
  Gets information about the browser screen. </P>
<P>You may think that screen is the same as innerHeight and innerWidth but they 
  are not. As an example, create a new HTML page from <a href="javascript_templates-2.html" target="_blank">your 
  template </a>with SCRIPT tags in the HEAD section. Now add the following Javascript:</P>
<P align="center"><a href="The%20innerHeight%20of%20a%20web%20page-2.html"><img src="images/chapter_1/window_innerHeight-2.gif" border="0"></a></P>
<P>So it's just an alert box with <b>window.innerHeight</b> between the two round 
  brackets. Previously, we had text in between the round brackets surrounded by 
  double quotes.</P>
<P>Save your page and load it into your browser. When the page loads, you should 
  see this:</P>
<P align="center"><a href="Javascript%20Alert%20showing%20innerHeight-2.html"><img src="images/chapter_1/window_innerHeight_alert-2.gif" border="0"></a></P>
<P>The 908 in the alert box means 908 pixels worth of height. Yours may well be 
  different. It depends on how big your monitor is, and how many toolbars you 
  have in your browser. The alert box above is from Firefox. Here's the same web 
  page in Internet Explorer version 9:</P>
<P align="center"><a href="Javascript%20Alert%20showing%20innerHeight%20in%20Internet%20Explorer-2.html"><img src="images/chapter_1/window_innerHeight_alert_IE-2.gif" border="0"></a></P>
<P>Our Internet Explorer has no toolbars, just the address bar at the top, so 
  the number of pixels is greater.</P>
<P>Now reduce the size of your browser. In windows, you can click the Restore 
  Down icon to do this. (The Restore Down icon is just to the left of the red 
  X in the top right.) Mac users can resize with the mouse pointer held over the 
  bottom right of the browser.</P>
<P>Refresh your page by hitting the F5 key on your keyboard. Your innerHeight 
  value should change:</P>
<P align="center"><a href="Javascript%20alert%20showing%20how%20innerHeight%20changes%20on%20resize-2.html"><img src="images/chapter_1/window_innerHeight_alert2-2.gif" border="0"></a></P>
<P>Now change your alert box code to this:</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">alert( window.screen.height )</P>
<P>This time, we're using the height value of the screen object. Save your work 
  and refresh. No matter what size you have the browser, you should see the same 
  screen height:</P>
<P align="center"><a href="Javascript%20alert%20showing%20screen%20height-2.html"><img src="images/chapter_1/window_screen_alert-2.gif" border="0"></a></P>
<P>For us, the screen height is 1080 pixels. It will remain 1080 pixels whether 
  we have a big browser size or large browser size. </P>
<P>So if you're trying to get the available size that a web page has, you should 
  not rely on the window.screen objects. </P>
<p><b>window.navigator</b><br>
  Used to gets information about the browser. The navigator object exposes lots 
  of other objects you can use. For example, there's this one:<br>
</p>
<p><b>window.navigator.cookieEnabled</b><br>
  If you put that between the round brackets of an alert box it will tell you 
  if cookies have been enabled in your browser. This is usually used in an</p>
<p>IF Statement, though. If the answer is yes, then a cookie can be set on a user's 
  computer. If no, then you can ask people to enable cookies.</p>
<p>Other navigator objects are:<br>
</p>
<P align="center"><b>appName<br>
  appVersion<br>
  language<br>
  platform<br>
  userAgent</b></P>
<P>Try them out in an alert box and see what they do. You can't rely on the first 
  two, however. appName, for example, will return Netscape in Firefox and Safari. 
  You can use userAgent to detect if someone is surfing your site with, say, an 
  iPad. The userAgent will say something like:</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">&quot;Mozilla/5.0(iPad; CPU OS 5_0_1 like Mac OS X)&quot;</P>
<P><b>window.location</b><br>
  You can do some quite advanced stuff with the location object, but the main 
  use of location is to redirect a user to another web page. For example, if you 
  detected someone was using an iPad then you can redirect them to your iPad optimised 
  page. The location object is used like this:</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">window.location = &quot;http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/&quot;;</P>
<P>After an equal sign, you type the name of the web page or site that you want 
  your visitors to go to. This needs to go between quotation marks. Notice the 
  use of a semicolon at the end of the line above. This is not strictly necessary. 
  But it is recommend that you separate each line of code with a semicolon. We'll 
  be doing that from now on.<br>
</P>
