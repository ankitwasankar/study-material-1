</HEADER><SECTION> 
<P>The Window object also has something called Methods. A method is a chunk of 
  code that does a particular job. The alert, confirm, and prompt boxes you have 
  been using are methods. If we were being exact we would have written this:</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">window.alert(&quot;Alert Message&quot;)</P>
<P>And this:</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">window.confirm(&quot;OK or Cancel&quot;)</P>
<P>But because the Window object is a Global object you don't have to use window 
  &quot;dot&quot; notation. You can just type the part after window. For clarity's 
  sake, though, it's better to keep the window part wherever possible as it's 
  clearer to you what your code means.</P>
<P>Other window methods that are commonly used are these:</P>
<P align="center"><b>window.clearInterval<br>
  window.clearTimeout <br>
  window.close<br>
  window.open<br>
  window.print<br>
  window.setInterval<br>
  window.setTimeout</b></P>
<p>The first two and the last two or used to set up and manipulate timers. Timers 
  are very useful in animation. We'll explore animation much later. The close 
  and open methods do what you'd expect them to do - close a window and open a 
  new one. The print method brings up an Operating System's print dialogue box. 
  Let's have a look at the <b>window.open</b> method more closely.</p>
<P align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* js_top */
google_ad_slot = "5820968310";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;

</script>

<h3>window.open</h3>
<p>It's quite useful to be able to open up a new window from the current page. 
  For example, we use it on our site for the &quot;contact us&quot; links. The 
  new window then contains things like email address, phone numbers, etc. The 
  new window typically opens when you click a hyperlink on a web page. You can 
  also have a window open when a web page loads, so-called popup windows (which 
  can be very annoying for your visitors).</p>
<p>The code below illustrates how to open up a new window when a hyperlink is 
  clicked. Don't worry about understanding this code yet, as it's a bit complicated 
  at this stage of your programming career. But it uses something called a function. 
  The function is called into action when the hyperlink is clicked. You'll study 
  functions later in this course. Here's the code, though:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/window_open_code.gif"></p>
<p>That part that opens and configures the new window is this (it's only on three 
  lines above so as to fit on the page):</p>
<p class="indent_small">window.open(&quot;popup.html&quot;, &quot;PopUp&quot;, 
  &quot;toolbar=no,width=500,height=300&quot;);</p>
<p>In between the round brackets of open are three thing: the page you want to 
  appear in your new window (popup.html for us), then a name for your new window 
  (PopUp, but it can be just about anything you want), and finally the configuration 
  options for the window. We have three configuration options: one to set the 
  toolbar to no, one to set the width of the window, and one to set the height. 
  All the configuration options go between a set of quotation marks, with no spaces 
  between each option and its value. All three options are separated by commas.</p>
<p>Here are some more configuration options you can have:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>left</b> - the left position of the window 
  in pixels</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>top</b> - the top position of the window in 
  pixels</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>height</b> - height of the window's viewing 
  area. Minimun height is 100 pixels 
<P class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>width</b> - width of the window viewing area. 
  Minimun width is 100 pixels </p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>menubar</b> - gets you the File, Edit, View, 
  etc, menus at the top.</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>toolbar</b> - gets you the standard toolbar: 
  back, forward arrows, etc</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>location</b> - gets you the Address bar, to 
  type web address in</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>scrollbars</b> - gets you scroll horizontal 
  and vertical scroll bars</p>
<p>If you don't list a feature above then it is turned off by default. In our 
  code above, we didn't need to say &quot;toolbar=no&quot; because &quot;no&quot; 
  is the default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>window.alert</b>, <b>window.confirm</b>, <b>window.prompt</b><br>
  You have already used these dialogue boxes. But just take note of the fact they 
  are methods of the window object</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Window Events</h3>
<P>When we opened a new window above, we did so from a hyperlink between the two 
  BODY tags. The hyperlink text was this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onClick=&quot;eAdd()&quot;&gt;Link 
  Text Here&lt;/A&gt;</P>
<P>The onClick part is something called an event. Lots of other objects between 
  the two BODY tags can use the onClick event. For example, a button on a form, 
  check boxes, drop-down lists, images - in fact, just about anything between 
  the BODY tags. But the idea is to call some Javascript code into action when 
  the event takes place.</P>
<P>There are lots of window events you can use. You can probably guess what most 
  of them are used for.</P>
<P align="center"><b>onChange<br>
  onClose<br>
  onKeydown<br>
  onKeypress<br>
  onKeyup<br>
  onLoad<br>
  onMousedown<br>
  onMousemove<br>
  onMouseout<br>
  onMouseover<br>
  onMouseup<br>
  onScroll<br>
  onSelect<br>
  onSubmit<br>
  onUnload</b></P>
<P>We won't go through the whole list just yet, but you'll meet quite a few of 
  these events throughout this course.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coming up next, we'll take a look at a crucial window object called Document.</P>
