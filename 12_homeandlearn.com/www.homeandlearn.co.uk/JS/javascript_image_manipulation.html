</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>You can use Javascript to get at and manipulate images. This may involve creating 
  new images, setting up an array of images, changing the source attribute in 
  the BODY tag, or just doing some simple (or not so simple) animation with them. 
  Let's start with referencing images in the BODY tag.</P>
  <P align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* js_top */
google_ad_slot = "5820968310";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script></P>
<h3>Images in the BODY tag</h3>
<P>Any images you place between the two BODY tags of your HTML pages can be seen 
  by Javascript. This is because whenever you add a picture with the IMG tag it 
  is placed in a collection, which is a sort of array. The first picture that 
  the browser can see, the one closet to the opening BODY tag, is place at position 
  0 in the collection. The second picture will be placed at position1, the third 
  at position 2, etc.</P>
<P>So let's have a look at some code to see how that works. Create a new web page 
  from <a href="javascript_templates.html" target="_blank">your template</a> for 
  this and save it to its own folder. Now download these two pictures (right click 
  each one, and then select &quot;Save Image As&quot; in Firefox, or &quot;Save 
  Picture As&quot; in Internet Explorer). Save them inside of the new folder:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/home.jpg" width="50" height="50"> <img src="images/home2.jpg" width="50" height="50"></P>
<P>For your web page, move the two SCRIPT tags inside the BODY of the HTML, right 
  at the end:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_7/collection_html_script.gif" width="400" height="218" alt="Basic HTML and SCRIPT code"></P>
<P>Now add the following HTML:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_7/collection_html_tags.gif" width="532" height="229" alt="HTML tags for two images"></P>
<P>So we're adding HTML for two images, a button and a label. Save your work and 
  your web page will look like this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_7/collection_webpage.gif" width="106" height="213" alt="Web page with two images and a button"></P>
<P>What we want to do here is to click the button and get a list all the images 
  in the HTML. We'll print out the list on the label, which has an ID of <b>label_1</b>. 
  The button has an onClick event. The function we want to call is <b>image_test</b>.</P>
<P>Add the <b>image_test</b> function between your two SCRIPT tags. </P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE = &quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">function image_test() {</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">}</P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</P>
<p>Now add the following line to the function:</p>
<P class="indent_big">var len = document.images.length;</P>
<P>To access all the images in your HTML document you only need the word images. 
  You add it after the dot of document. The length property at the end returns 
  the number of images the document has. To store all the images in an array, 
  the code is this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var imgs = document.images;</P>
<P>So it's just document.images. The image array will then be stored in the variable 
  to the left of the equal sign.</P>
<P>If you don't want to set up an array, you can just do this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">document.images[0].src</P>
<P>The code above will return the SRC part of image 0 in your HTML. </P>
<P>Another way to get at all the images is like this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName( 'img' );</P>
<P>You've already used getElementById. But you can also access the elements in 
  your HTML code with getElementsByTagName. Note where all the capital letters 
  are, and that Elements is plural. You use it to access collections, like all 
  the images, or all the hyperlinks, or all the P tags. </P>
<P>Between the round brackets of getElementsByTagName you need the name of the 
  tag you're trying to access. We want to get at all the image tags, so have typed 
  img between two single quotes. (You can use double quotes, if you prefer. And 
  the tag name doesn't have to be in lowercase, like we have it .) If you wanted 
  to access all the hyperlinks on the page, you would type 'a' (or 'A') between 
  the round brackets. The first link would then be at position 0 in the array.</P>
<P>To test all that theory out, add the following code to your script (the lines 
  in bold):</P>
<P class="indent_big_no_bold">var len = document.images.length;</P>
<P class="indent_big">var imgs = document.images;<br>
  document.getElementById(&quot;label_1&quot;).innerHTML = imgs[0].src;</P>
<p>You should find that a file path and image name will appear in the label:file_path/folder_name/home.jpg</p>
<p>Now change the second line of your Javascript to this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName( 'img' );</p>
<p>After the innerHTML line, change the 0 into a 1. So this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.getElementById(&quot;label_1&quot;).innerHTML = 
  imgs[1].src;</p>
<p>You should find that the file path and image name of the second picture ends 
  up in the label.</p>
<p>You can loop through all the images on your page. Change you code to match 
  ours below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/chapter_7/collection_loop.gif" alt="Javascript code looping through all the images on a HTML page"></p>
<p>Once you're done, save your work and refresh. Click the button again and you 
  should find that both file names print out.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you were wondering why we added the SCRIPT tags at the end 
  of the BODY section, it's because code in the HEAD section gets executed first. 
  When you're experimenting with Javascript and images this could lead to errors 
  as the images in the BODY section may not have finished loading. Our simple 
  code is OK, though, as we're delaying execution by putting all the Javascript 
  in a function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>In the next part, you'll see how to create new images with Javascript, as we 
  code for a basic image scroller.</P>
