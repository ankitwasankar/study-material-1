</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>One programming tool common to all languages is the loop. Normally, a programme 
  is executed from top to bottom, with each line of code getting processed in 
  turn. If you want to go back up and not down, you can use a loop. Loops are 
  a great way to execute lines of code again and again. There are many reasons 
  why you want to do this. But take the following sum as an example:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var total;<br>
  total = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10;</P>
<p>The code above just adds up the numbers 1 to 10. Which is fine if you only 
  have 10 numbers. But supposed you have a 100 numbers, or 1000. You can't really 
  type them all out. With a loop, though, you can add up a 1000, 10000 numbers, 
  in just a few lines of code. The most common type a loop is called a for loop.</p>

<h3>For Loops</h3>
<P>For loops (lowercase &quot;f&quot;) are structured like this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/for_loop_structure-2.gif" alt="The structure of a Javascript for loop"></P>
<P>So you start with the word <b>for</b>. After a space you have a pair of round 
  brackets. In between the round brackets you need three things, separated by 
  semicolons: a start value for your loop, some way for the loop to end, and a 
  way to get from one to the other, which is known as the increment value. Next 
  come a pair of curly brackets. The code you want to execute repeatedly goes 
  between the curly brackets. Here's a for loop that adds up the numbers 1 to 
  10. Try it out by creating a web page from <a href="javascript_templates-2.html" target="_blank">the 
  template in a previous section</a>.</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/for_loops-2.gif" alt="Javascript for loop used to add numbers"></P>
<P>The first thing to notice here is that we're setting up variables to hold the 
  start value of the loop and the end value. Loops are designed to go round and 
  around a set number of times. You have to tell Javascript how many times you 
  want to go round. So you need a starting value, and an end value. There are 
  many ways to set an end value, but here we're saying, &quot;Keep going round 
  in a loop until the start value is no longer less than the end value.&quot; 
  But how does the loop know that the start value is less than the end value? 
  It knows because we've set an increment value. It's this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">start_value++</P>
<P>This is a shorthand way of saying &quot;add 1 to the <b>start_value</b> variable&quot;. 
  It's called incrementing a variable. The longhand way to increment a variable 
  is this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">start_value = start_value + 1</P>
<P>If you do the calculation on the right hand side of the equal sign first, the 
  line above will make more sense. Javascript will look at what's currently in 
  the <b>start_value</b> variable, and then add 1 to it. Once it's done that it 
  will place the result into the variable on the left of the equal sign, erasing 
  its contents and thus setting a new value. The result is that the <b>start_value</b> 
  variable keeps increasing by 1 each time round the loop.</P>
<P>You can also take 1 away from numbers with this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">start_value--</P>
<P>Two minus signs after a variable are called the decrement operator. They deduct 
  1 from whatever is in the variable. It is the same as saying this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">start_value = start_value - 1</P>
<P>To recap, the start value of the loop is whatever number we have put in the 
  <b>start_value</b> variable; the end condition is when the <b>start_value</b> 
  is no longer less than whatever value we have put in the <b>end_value</b> variable; 
  and the way we get from one to the other is by incrementing the <b>start_value</b> 
  variable.</P>
<P>Now have a look at what's in the curly brackets of the loop:</P>
<P class="indent_big">answer = answer + start_value;</P>
<P>This is the whole point of having a loop - to run some code over and over again.</P>
<P>We want to add up the numbers 1 to 10. So, again, do the calculation to the 
  right of the equal sign first. Javascript will look at whatever value is currently 
  held in the <b>answer</b> variable. The first time round the loop this will 
  be zero. (It's zero because we set it that way at the top of the code.) Add 
  1 to zero to get an answer of 1. This is then stored in the variable to the 
  left of the equal sign. This is the <b>answer</b> variable again. The <b>answer</b> 
  variable will have its contents erased and the new value (1) placed inside of 
  it.</P>
<P>Now, because we're incrementing the <b>start_value</b> variable each time round 
  the loop, its value keeps changing. So the second time round the loop the values 
  will be these:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/loop_value_1-2.gif" alt="Javascript loop values - first time round the loop"></P>
<P>So we're adding 1 + 2 on the right of the equal sign. The answer ( 3) then 
  gets stored to the left of the equal sign. Which means the third time round 
  the loop the values will be these (remember: do the calculations to the right 
  of the equal sign first, and then store the result to the left):</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/loop_value_2-2.gif" alt="Javascript loop values - second time round the loop"></P>
<P>And the fourth time round the loop the values will be:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/loop_value_3-2.gif" alt="Javascript loop values - third time round the loop"></P>
<P>The <b>start_value</b> keeps going up by 1 each time round. It's getting towards 
  the correct answer! Have a look at the fifth time round the loop:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/loop_value_4-2.gif" alt="Javascript loop values - fourth time round the loop"></P>
<P>The final line of our code just writes out the answer. To get a better idea 
  of what's going on, add this document.write inside of the loop's curly brackets:</P>
<P class="indent_small">answer = answer + start_value;<br>
  document.write( &quot;answer= &quot; + answer + &quot; start value = &quot; 
  + start_value + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);</P>
<P>When you run then code you should see the following in the browser:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/for_loops_printed-2.gif" alt="Output of Javascript loop code"></P>
<P>By then end, then, answer is 55. We've went 10 times round the loop, adding 
  up each time round.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Use a for loop to print out the numbers 1 to 20.</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Use a for loop to print out the odd numbers from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus 
  for this. And an IF Statement.) Your for loop should look like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">for ( start_value; start_value &lt; end_value; start_value++ 
  ) {</p>
<p class="indent_big">if ( ) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">document.write(&quot;answer= &quot; + start_value + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>Obviously, you'll need something between the round brackets of your IF Statement. 
  But what?</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Common end values</h3>
<P>Another common end value for loops is to get the length of something, the length 
  of a string of text, for example, or the length of an array (you'll learn about 
  arrays in a later section). In the code below, notice how we're using length:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var start_value = 1;</P>
<P class="indent_big">var some_string = &quot;ABCDEFGH&quot;;</P>
<P class="indent_big">for ( start_value; start_value &lt; some_string.length; 
  start_value++ ) {</P>
<P class="indent_big">}</P>
<P>The length method is available to all strings and tells you how many characters 
  a string of text has. We're looping round while the start value is less than 
  the length of the some_string. As soon as the start value goes above the length 
  of the string the loop will end.<br>
  But we'll explain the end value for loops whenever we meet them, so try not 
  to worry about them too much.</P>
