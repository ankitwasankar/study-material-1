<P>In programming terminology, a variable is a storage area. You store things 
  in variables so that you can retrieve them later. Think of variables as small 
  boxes. You can write a number on a piece of paper then place that piece of paper 
  in a box. Write a label on the box, such as &quot;Mom's phone number&quot;, 
  and you'll have a quick way to identify what kind of information you have stored 
  in the box. One day, you might even decide to phone Mom. If so, you can quickly 
  locate her phone number by looking at the label on the box and pulling out the 
  piece of paper with her number on it.</P>

<P>In Javascript, when you're setting up a variable you start with the letters 
  <B>var</B> (short for variable, of course). After a space, you then need to come up 
  with a name for your variable (like &quot;Mom's phone number&quot;). The name 
  can be almost anything you want. But there are some important considerations. 
  These:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>You can't have spaces in your variable</LI>
  <LI>You can't start your variable name with a number</LI>
  <LI>The variable should contain only letters, numbers ( but not the first character 
    of the variable), a dollar sign ($) and an underscore ( _ )</LI>
</UL>
<P>Here are some valid variable names:</P>
<P align="center"><b>number1<br>
  moms_phone_number<br>
  $firstName</b></P>
<P>And here are some that will get you into trouble:</P>
<P align="center"><b>1number<br>
  moms phone number<br>
  &quot;firstName&quot;</b></P>
<p>For the ones that will get you into trouble, the first variable starts with 
  a number, the second one has spaces, and the third is surrounded with double 
  quotes.</p>
<P>To store something in a variable, you use an equals symbols ( = ). You can 
  store numbers, strings of text and Boolean values in a variable. (Boolean values 
  are Yes/No, True/False, 1 or 0.) These three, numbers, strings, and Booleans, 
  are called <b>primitive data types</b>. As well as the primitive data types 
  you can also store objects in variables, objects like the Window, Navigator, 
  and Document objects you met earlier.</P>
<P>Let's get some practical work done, though.<br>
</P>
<P>Create a new web page for this. You can use <a href="javascript_templates.html" target="_blank">the 
  template you created in an earlier section</a>. Add the Javascript tags to the 
  HEAD section of the HTML. In between the Javascript tags, set up the following 
  three variable and their values:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var number1 = 42;<br>
  var true_or_false = true;<br>
  var firstName = 'Kenny';</P>
<p>Your web page should then look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/chapter_2/3_variables.gif" alt="Javascript code setting up three varaibles"></p>
<p>So we have three Javascript variables set up, all starting with the keyword 
  <b>var</b>. The first variable stores the number 42, the second one stores a 
  value of true, and the third one stores the text 'Kenny'. Notice that the first 
  two variables, the number and the Boolean, don't need any quote marks. The third 
  one does, however: if you want to store strings of text they need to go between 
  quotations marks, either single quotes or double quotes, but not a mixture of 
  the two.</p>
<p>Now add the following write lines to your code</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.write( number1 + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; );<br>
  document.write( true_or_false + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; );<br>
  document.write( firstName + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; );</p>
<p>So we're using document.write to see what's inside of the variables. (The + 
  &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; is just so that each variable will be printed on a line 
  of its own.)</p>
<p>Your Javascript should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/chapter_2/3_variables_write.gif" alt="Javascript code using varaibles and document.write"></p>
<p>Make sure you end each line with a semicolon ( ; ). Make sure, too, that you 
  have a space between var and the variable name. You don't actually need a space 
  to the left and right of the equal symbol, but it helps to make your code more 
  readable.</p>
<p>Save your work and load your web page in a browser. You should find the following 
  written to your page:</p>
<p align="center"><b>42<br>
  true<br>
  Kenny</b></p>
<p>So what just happened? Well, we stored three values in three variables. We 
  retrieved these values by just using the variable names. For example, if you 
  had the code alert( number1) the alert box would display the value 42, which 
  we stored in the variable we called number1. In other words, to get at the value 
  itself, you just use the variable name.</p>
<p>You can use concatenation with variable names. For example, you can do this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">document.write( &quot;The variable has a value of: &quot; 
  + number1 + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);</p>
<p>Here, we've combined the text &quot;The variable has a value of: &quot; with 
  the variable name number1. We did the combining (concatenation) with the plus 
  symbol ( + ). Try it yourself. Amend your document.write code so that it looks 
  like our below:</p>
<p class="indent_small">document.write( &quot;The variable has a value of: &quot; 
  + number1 + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);<br>
  document.write( &quot;Is it true or false? &quot; + true_or_false + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);<br>
  document.write( &quot;What's your first name? &quot; + firstName + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;);</p>
<p>Make sure you get the quotation marks and the plus symbols in the right place, 
  otherwise your code won't work. (You don't have to use double quotes, single 
  quotes work just as well. You can't have a double quote at the start, though, 
  and a single quote at the end.)</p>
<p>The results in a browser should look like this:<br>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Variable Assignment </h3>
<p>When setting up a variable, we did this:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent_big">var number1 = 42;</p>
<p>But you don't have to store a value in the variable all on the same line. You 
  can use two lines instead:</p>
<p class="indent_big">var number1;<br>
  number1 = 42;</p>
<p>The first line here creates a variable called <b>number1</b>. But there's nothing 
  stored in it. The second line is where we store something in the variable. Note 
  that the <b>var</b> has now gone missing - you only need to use <b>var</b> once 
  when you're setting up your variables.</p>
<p>You can also assign a different value to a variable. For example, you can do 
  this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">var number1;<br>
  number1 = 42;<br>
  number1 = 100;</p>
<p>Javascript is a sequential programming language, meaning lines get executed 
  from top to bottom. What we've done above is to first assign a value of 42 to 
  the variable called <b>number1</b>. The third line stores a new number in this 
  same variable. The two are not added together. When you assign a new number 
  to a variable, it will erase the old contents. So the variable <b>number1</b> 
  will now hold a value of 100.</p>
<p>You can also overwrite the number 42 with a string of text. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">var number1;<br>
  number1 = 42;<br>
  number1 = &quot;one hundred&quot;;</p>
<p>This time the text &quot;one hundred&quot; is stored in the variable called 
  number1, even though previously the variable held a number. Other languages 
  wouldn't let you do this. If you set up a variable to hold a number then an 
  error would be raised if you tried to store text in it. Javascript, however, 
  doesn't care.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, you'll learn about the mathematical operators in Javascript.<br>
