<H1 ID="Article">Document Object Model - the DOM</H1>
</HEADER><SECTION> 
<P> The Document is another Window object you can manipulate. It's quite a powerful 
  object as it refers to just about all the elements you can have on a web page 
  (forms, links, images, text, HTML code, etc). This means that you can use Javascript 
  to get at HTML elements, amend them, and add new ones. This is quite advanced 
  stuff, however, and we'll only go through a few of the document objects in this 
  beginner's book. But to get an idea of just how many document properties and 
  methods are available, have a look at this page: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document</a>. 
  Whole books have been written on the subject!</P>
<P>One really useful document method is <b>write</b>. We'll take a look at that 
  now.</P>
<P align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* js_top */
google_ad_slot = "5820968310";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script></P>
<h3>document.write</h3>
<P>The document's write method can be used to insert text onto your web page (this 
  text can actually be HTML elements). Try this as an example:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Create a new HTML web page from <a href="javascript_templates-2.html" target="_blank">your 
    template</a></LI>
  <LI>Save it with the name write_method.html</LI>
  <LI>Add the following H1 heading to the HTML: <b>&lt;H1&gt;The document.write 
    method&lt;/H1&gt;</b></LI>
  <LI>Put two SCRIPT tags in the BODY section of the HTML</LI>
  <LI>Between the two SCRIPT tags, add the following:</LI>
</UL>
<P class="indent_big">document.write( window.screen.height );</P>
<P>(Notice the semicolon at the end of the line. We'll use them to separate each 
  line of code from now on.)</P>
<P>Your new HTML page and Javascript code should look like this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/write_method-2.gif" alt="Javascript code showing the document.write method"></P>
<P>Save your work and open up the web page in a browser. You should see this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/write_method_browser-2.gif" alt="document.write in a browser"></P>
<P>Instead of an alert box, we're now writing the screen height directly to the 
  web page. (Your screen height may well be different.)</P>
<P>Now cut the Javascript from the BODY section and paste it into the HEAD section 
  of the HTML. Save your work and refresh the page in your browser. You should 
  see this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/write_method_browser_2-2.gif" alt="document.write in a browser"></P>
<P>The reason the screen height is now at the top is that the code in the HEAD 
  section gets executed first. But the browser doesn't wait until the whole page 
  loads - it executes the Javascript in the HEAD section first. This contained 
  the document.write method. Because the write method writes to the page then 
  this happens before any HTML is displayed.</P>
<P>Put the Javascript code back into the BODY section. Amend your code to this:</P>
<P class="indent_small">document.write(&quot;Screen Height=&quot; + window.screen.height);</P>
<P>What we've done here is something concatenation. This just means joining strings 
  of text together. We've added some direct text between quotation marks. After 
  a plus symbol ( + ) we then have the screen height code. The plus symbol when 
  used like this means &quot;join together&quot;. You can use it as many times 
  as you want. For example:</P>
<P class="indent_small">document.write(&quot;SH=&quot; + window.screen.height 
  + &quot; SW=&quot; + window.screen.width);</P>
<P>The SH and SW above obviously mean Screen Height and Screen Width. But note 
  where all the plus symbols, commas and spaces are. Get your plus symbols and/or 
  commas wrong and your code won't work.</P>
<P>You can use HTML tags with concatenation. For example, if you want to spread 
  things over two lines, you can use the BR tag. Like this:</P>
<P class="indent_small">document.write(&quot;SH=&quot; + window.screen.height 
  + &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; + &quot;SW=&quot; + window.screen.width);</P>
<P>The BR tag is surrounded by quotation marks. You need the quote marks for any 
  HTML that you insert using the write method.</P>
<P>You can use document.write as many times as you want. In the code below, we 
  have moved the SCRIPT tags back to the HEAD section. We then used document.write 
  twice: once to add the H1 line, and once to add the text below it.</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/write_method_2-2.gif" alt="document.write used to create HTML"></P>
<P>Try these two exercises to get the hang of document.write.</P>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Use concatenation with document.write to create the following in your browser:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/write_method_ex1-2.gif" alt="A document.write exercise for Javascript beginners"></p>
<P>We used <b>document.write</b> twice here. The first one wrote a H1 heading. 
  The second one combined the text &quot;Your browser is set to:&quot; with <b>window.navigator.language</b>. 
  We also have bold text for the browser language (your language may be different 
  - it depends where you are in the world). Of course, you'll need to know what 
  the HTML tag for bold text is!</P>
<P><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Use document.write to create an address like the one below:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/write_method_ex2-2.gif" alt="A document.write exercise for Javascript beginners"></P>
<P>This address is centre aligned in the browser, with the first line in bold. 
  We used document.write seven times. Five of those seven times are for the address. 
  The other two are used to get the centre alignment. So you start with:</P>
<P class="indent_big">document.write(&quot;&lt;P Align=center&gt;&quot;);</P>
<p>And the last line is:</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.write(&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&quot;);</p>
<p>What this does is to get you a paragraph with the alignment. The other five 
  uses of document.write are for inside of these two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>In the next lesson, you'll learn about Javascript variables.</P>
