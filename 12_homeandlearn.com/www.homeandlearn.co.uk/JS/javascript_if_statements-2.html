</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>Javascript is what's known as a sequential programming language. This means 
  that each and every line of code is executed from top to bottom. Quite often, 
  however, you don't want every line to execute - you'll want more control over 
  the way your programmes work.</P>
<P>One way to control the flow of your code is with conditional logic. Conditional 
  logic is all about what happens IF a condition is met or not met. For example, 
  you may have an email text box on a form that you want your users to fill in. 
  You don't want this text box to be empty when the user click the SUBMIT button. 
  So you need a way to say &quot;IF the email address is missing THEN don't send 
  the form&quot;. You do this with IF Statement.<br>

<h3>IF Statements</h3>
<P>You can use an IF Statement to control the flow of your Javascript code. An 
  IF Statement will evaluate to either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. They look 
  like this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">if ( condition_to_test) { </P>
<P class="indent_big">}</P>
<P>So it's just the word &quot;if&quot; in lowercase. Next comes a pair of round 
  brackets. In between the round brackets you need a condition to test. The condition 
  will be evaluated and checked if it's true. If your condition is true then whatever 
  code you have between a pair of curly brackets will get executed. IF your condition 
  is false then the code between the curly brackets will be ignored. Take the 
  following code as an example:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var first_name = &quot;Kenny&quot;;</P>
<P class="indent_big">if ( first_name == &quot;Kenny&quot; ) {</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">document.write( &quot;First Name is Kenny &quot; + first_name 
  );</P>
<P class="indent_big">}</P>
<P>The first line of the code stores the text &quot;Kenny&quot; into a variable 
  called <b>first_name</b>. Next we have our IF Statement. The condition we're 
  testing is between the round brackets:</P>
<P class="indent_big">first_name == &quot;Kenny&quot;</P>
<P>So we're checking to see whether or not the variable called <b>first_name</b> 
  contains the word &quot;Kenny&quot;. Notice that we now have two equal symbols 
  (==) between the variable we want to check and the text we are checking for. 
  The double equal symbols mean &quot;has a value of&quot;. It's not assigning 
  a value &quot;Kenny&quot; to the variable, like it would if there were only 
  one equal symbol. The whole line, then, reads like this: &quot;IF the variable 
  called <b>first_name</b> has a value of Kenny&quot;. Javascript will test the 
  truth of that statement. IS it true, or is it false? It is indeed true. In which 
  case Javascript can go ahead and execute the code between the curly brackets.</P>
<P>In fact try that code out. Create a new web page from <a href="javascript_templates-2.html" target="_blank">your 
  template</a>. Type the code above between your two Javascript tags. Your code 
  should then look like this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_3/basic_if-2.gif" alt="Javascript code showing an IF statement"></P>
<P>Make sure you have the correct format for the new if statements (the correct 
  syntax, as it's called). The first line, the one that starts with var, needs 
  a single equal sign ( = ). This is because we're assigning a value of &quot;Kenny&quot; 
  to the variable. In between the two round brackets of the IF statement, however, 
  you need two equal signs (==). They mean &quot;has a value of&quot;. You also 
  need two curly brackets for IF statements. In between the curly bracket is where 
  your code goes.</P>
<P>Save your work and test the results in a browser. You should see the following 
  printed to your page:</P>
<P class="indent_big">First Name is Kenny Kenny</P>
<P>So we have Kenny written twice. The first time is because we typed &quot;Kenny&quot; 
  between a pair of double quotes. The second time is because Javascript writes 
  whatever is in the variable <b>first_name</b>. To see why you need two double 
  equal symbols, delete one of them from between the round brackets of the IF 
  statements. Now change &quot;Kenny&quot; to &quot;Lenny&quot;:</P>
<P class="indent_big">if ( first_name = &quot;Lenny&quot; ) {</P>
<P>Save your changes and run the code again. This time, you'll see the following:</P>
<P class="indent_big">First Name is Kenny Lenny</P>
<P>Even though we assigned a value of &quot;Kenny&quot; to the variable in the 
  first line (<b>var first_name = &quot;Kenny&quot;</b>) Javascript has changed 
  it to &quot;Lenny&quot;. This is because we changed the double equal signs to 
  a single equal sign in the IF statement. This assigns a new value to the variable. 
</P>
<P>So be careful when typing out your conditions between the round brackets of 
  an IF statement: two equals signs checks a value, just one assigns a value.<br>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the next part, we'll look at IF ... ELSE Statements.</P>
