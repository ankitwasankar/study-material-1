</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>Fire up whatever text editor you're comfortable with. For us, we're going to 
  be using Notepad on a Windows machine. Add the simple HTML you see below:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/first_script_html-2.gif" alt="HTML code for a basic web page"></P>
<P>So we have the HEAD and BODY tags of a HTML page, along with a TITLE area at 
  the top. Save your text file with the name <b>first_script.html</b>. If you're 
  using Notepad then you need to change the <b>Save As Type</b> area at the bottom 
  to <b>All Files</b>, otherwise you'll end up with a text file rather than a 
  HTML page that you can load into a browser. (You don't need to do this if you're 
  using TextEdit on a Mac. Just type <b>first_script.html</b> in the Save As box.)</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/all_files-2.gif" alt="The Save As dialogue box"></P>
<P>We now need to add some Javascript tags. In between the two BODY tags, then, 
  add the following:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/first_script_alert-2.gif" alt="Script tags added to the body section of a  HTML page"></P>
<P>The lines you're adding are these:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE = &quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;</P>
<p class="indent_big"> alert(&quot;Hello World&quot;)</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</p>
<p>Programming scripts are added between two &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags, an opening one 
  and a closing one. An attribute to the SCRIPT tag is LANGUAGE. This tells the 
  browser which scripting language is being used. For us, this is Javascript. 
  This goes after an equal sign ( = ). Notice that we've surrounded the word Javascript 
  with double quote marks. But you don't have to. In fact, you can miss out the 
  LANGUAGE attribute altogether and just have this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> alert(&quot;Hello World&quot;)</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</p>
<p>Any Javascript you want to add needs to go between the two SCRIPT tags. Careful 
  of the forward slash for the end SCRIPT tag - miss this out and your code won't 
  work. Like all HTML tags, though, the two SCRIPT tags can be lowercase, if you 
  prefer:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;script&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> alert(&quot;Hello World&quot;)</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>However, although the SCRIPT tags are not case sensitive Javascript very definitely 
  is. Our code consists of a single line, a simple alert box. All it does is to 
  display a dialogue box with the words &quot;Hello World&quot;. Try it out. Save 
  your work. Now use Windows Explorer or Finder on a Mac to navigate to where 
  you saved the HTML file. Double click to run your script in a browser. You should 
  see the following in Firefox:<br>
</p>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/alert_firefox-2.gif" alt="A Javascript alert box in Firefox"></P>
<P>Or this in Internet Explorer:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/alert_IE-2.gif" alt="A Javascript alert box in Internet Explorer"></P>
<P>Now change your alert line to this:</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">Alert(&quot;Hello World&quot;)</P>
<P>The word alert now has a capital &quot;A&quot;. Save your work and reload the 
  page in your browser. You should find that the alert box no longer displays. 
  Change it back to a lowercase &quot;a&quot;, save and reload. The alert box 
  will come back.</P>
<P>Alert Boxes are used to display information to your users. In between a pair 
  of round brackets, you type the text you want people to see. This text goes 
  between quote marks (single or double quotes, but not a mixture of the two).</P>
<P align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* js_top */
google_ad_slot = "5820968310";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script></P>
<h3>Confirm and Prompt</h3>
<P>As well as an alert box, you can have a <b>confirm</b> and a <b>prompt</b> 
  box. Using a confirm box will get you two buttons, OK and Cancel. They are normally 
  used with an IF Statements to detect which of the two buttons was clicked. You'll 
  learn about IF Statements in a later section, but the code for a Confirm box 
  is just this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">confirm(&quot;OK or Cancel?&quot;)</P>
<P>Again, the text you want to display goes between quote marks. In a browser, 
  the confirm box looks like this:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/confirm_box-2.gif"></P>
<P>A prompt box is used when you want some input from the user. The code for a 
  Prompt box is this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">prompt(&quot;Favourite Colour?&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;)</P>
<P>The prompt box has two parts between the round brackets. The first part is 
  the heading, while the second part is some default text. Here's what they look 
  like in a browser:<br>
</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_1/prompt_box-2.gif"></P>
<P>A user can enter some text in the text box. When the OK button is clicked you 
  can get at the text the user entered and do something with it. You'll see how 
  to do this in the IF Statements section.</P>
<P>For both confirm and prompt boxes lowercase letters are used.</P>
<P>In the next lesson, we'll take a look at where the javascript tags go</P>
