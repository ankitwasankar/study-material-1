<H1 ID="Article">Variable Scope</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>Variables have something called <b>scope</b>. This is do with where variables 
  can be seen from. Variables declared with the <b>var</b> keyword inside of functions 
  cannot be seen from outside of that function. Examine this code:</P>
<P class="indent_big">function myFunction() {</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">var alertString = &quot;ALERT!!!&quot;;<br>
  secondFunction();</P>
<P class="indent_big">}</P>
<p class="indent_big"> function secondFunction() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">alert( alertString );</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<P>The first function has a variable set up inside of its curly brackets called 
  <b>alertString</b>. It is set up with the <b>var</b> keyword. The second function 
  is trying to access this variable in an alert box. However, the code doesn't 
  work, and you get an error message saying &quot;alertString is not defined&quot;. 
  It doesn't work because the variable <b>alertString</b> is local to <b>myFunction</b> 
  (it's inside of this function's curly brackets and has been set up with the 
  var keyword). So the second function can't see inside of this variable.</P>
    <P align="center"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* js_top */
google_ad_slot = "5820968310";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script></P>
<P>To remedy this, you can make variables global in scope. All this entails is 
  declaring them outside of any functions. Like this:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var alertString = &quot;ALERT!&quot;;</P>
<p class="indent_big">function myFunction() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">secondFunction();</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p class="indent_big"> function secondFunction() {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">alert( alertString );</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<P>With the variable declared outside of the two functions, at the top, the code 
  will now work. (You can also miss out the word <b>var</b> keyword from inside 
  a function to turn the variable into a global one.)</P>
<P>However, scope in the Javascript language can be quite complex, especially 
  when you take into account things called closure and prototypes. So we won't 
  cover it any further in this beginners book. Just remember to take care when 
  declaring variables inside of functions - they can't be seen outside of that 
  function if you declare them with the <b>var</b> keyword.</P>
<P>To end this section, let's have a look at some code that uses functions in 
  a real setting. The HTML in the BODY section below sets up a text box and a 
  button. (We've missed out FORM tags just to keep things simple. But you'll learn 
  about Javascript and FORMS in a later chapter.) We want users to fill in this 
  box. If it's empty when the button is clicked we'll display an error message 
  just above the text box. Here's the code:</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/chapter_4/functions_textbox_2.gif" width="650" height="356" alt="Using functions in Javascript"></P>
<P>The BODY of the HTML has this code:</P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;P ID=&quot;message&quot;&gt;First Name&lt;/P&gt;<br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE =&quot;text&quot; SIZE=&quot;25&quot; VALUE=&quot;&quot; ID=&quot;Name&quot;&gt; 
  <br>
  &lt;INPUT TYPE =&quot;button&quot; value =&quot; SUBMIT &quot; onClick = &quot;validate()&quot;&gt;</P>
<p>The first line is just two paragraph tags with the text &quot;First Name&quot; 
  between them. The P tag also has an ID. We'll use this ID in our Javascript.</p>
<p>The next two lines are the tags for a text box and a button. The Text box also 
  has an ID. When the button is clicked, it calls the <b>validate</b> function 
  between the two SCRIPT tags in the HEAD section:</p>
<p class="indent_big">onClick = &quot;validate()&quot;</p>
<p>The first line of code for the validate function is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">var textbox_value = document.getElementById(&quot;Name&quot;).value;</p>
<p>We're setting up a variable called textbox_value here. Into this variable we 
  want to store the value from the text box. This is done via the <b>getElementById</b> 
  property of the document object (you'll learn about getElementById in later 
  section). Between its round brackets we have the ID from the text box. After 
  a dot, we have value. This is enough to get the VALUE attribute from the text 
  box.</p>
<p>We want to test what's in this text box so have set up an IF &#133; ELSE statement. 
  The IF part is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">if (textbox_value == &quot;&quot;) {</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">var error = &quot;&lt;span STYLE=color:red&gt;Required&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;<br>
  document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;).innerHTML = error;</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>The variable called error just stores some HTML and CSS:</p>
<p class="indent_big">&quot;&lt;span STYLE=color:red&gt;Required&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;</p>
<p>This is a SPAN tag with a style applied. It will cause the test &quot;Required&quot; 
  to be coloured red. Next is this line:</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;).innerHTML = 
  error;</p>
<p>This is setting some text in the HTML. That paragraph tag we set up had an 
  ID of message. We can use this with document.getElementById. Notice the <b>innerHTML</b> 
  part after the dot. This allows you to set text in your HTML. The inner HTML 
  is the parts between the two P tags:</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;P ID=&quot;message&quot;&gt;First Name&lt;/P&gt;</p>
<p>The inner HTML is &quot;First Name&quot;. This will be erased and replaced 
  with the new text. The new text goes after an equal sign. For us, this is whatever 
  is in the variable called <b>error</b>.</p>
<p>The else statement sets the innerHTML back to &quot;First Name&quot;. We don't 
  really need this, but it's there for testing purposes. </p>
<p>The <b>return false</b> line is also not needed in this simple piece of code. 
  But in reality, you'd add it if you were going to send your form data somewhere. 
  Adding <b>return false</b> cancels the sending so that the user can try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Try the code out for yourself. Typing it all out will give you some good practice 
  of setting up HTML and Javascript. When you click your button, you should see 
  the new text appear in red. Type some text in the text box and click the button 
  again. The First Name text should reappear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a lot more to functions, however. For example, you can create things 
  like function expressions (also known as an anonymous function) and self invoking 
  functions. This is intermediate to advanced stuff, however. As a beginner, it's 
  going to be easier to stick with the simple function declarations that we've 
  outlined in this section. For a more detailed discussion on functions, see the 
  following pages:</p>
