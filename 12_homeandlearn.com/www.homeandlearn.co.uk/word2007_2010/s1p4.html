        <h2 align="center">Saving your work</h2>
        <p>To save your work in Word 2007, click the round Office button in the 
          top left of your screen. You should see a menu appear:<br>
        </p>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/saveMenu.gif" width="429" height="519" alt="The Save menu in Word 2007"></P>
        <P align="left">In Word 2010, click the <b>File</b> tab at the top of 
          Word:</P>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/word_2010/file_save.gif" width="134" height="139" alt="The Save menu in Word 2010"></P>
        <P align="left">In both versions, when you click the <b>Save</b> item 
          you'll see a dialogue box appear (This image is from Windows 7. The 
          one for Windows Vista is very similar):</P>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB.gif" alt="The Save As dialogue box in Windows 7"></P>
        <P align="left">There are three main areas to the Save dialogue box: Where 
          do you want to save your document? What do you want to call it? What 
          type of document do you want to save it as?</P>
        <p>We'll take the three areas in turn, starting with &quot;Where do you 
          want to save your document?&quot;</p>
        <p>The &quot;Where&quot; is set right at the top. The default location 
          is in the <b>Documents</b> folder on your computer. You can see where 
          this is by clicking the arrow in the top left:<br>
        </p>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_2.gif" width="461" height="267" border="1" alt="Changing folders from the Save As dialogue box"></P>
        <P align="left">The dropdown menu is a list of locations on your computer. 
          The image above is from Windows 7 and shows that we are in the <b>Libraries</b> 
          folder. If you have Windows Vista, you won't see a Libraries entry. 
          It will say <b>Users</b>. There will then be another one next to Users 
          that has the user name you used when setting up your computer. For example: 
          <b>Users &gt; Kenny &gt; Documents</b>.</P>
        <p>Inside the Libraries folder is another one called <b>Documents</b>. 
          We're saving it to this folder. The larger area of the Save As dialogue 
          box shows you the folders that are already in the Documents folder:</p>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_3.gif" width="466" height="172" border="1" alt="Folder in the Documents folder, Windows 7"></P>
        <P align="left">You can create folders of your own to hold your work. 
          So click the <b>New Folder</b> button at the top:</P>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_newFolder.gif" width="269" height="88" border="1" alt="The New Folder icon"></P>
        <P align="left">You should see a new yellow folder appear in the main 
          area of the Save As dialogue box, with some blue highlighting:</P>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_newFolder2.gif" width="468" height="150" alt="A new folder has been created"></P>
        <P align="left">The blue highlighting means that it is ready to be typed 
          over. Type the name <b>My WP Projects</b>. Then press the enter key 
          on your keyboard (or just click away). The folder will then be renamed:</P>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_newFolder3.gif" width="379" height="27" alt="The folder has been renamed"></P>
        <P align="left">If you get it wrong, click back onto the folder. Now click 
          again, and you should see the same blue highlighting. Or just right 
          click the folder to see a new menu appear. Select <b>Rename</b> from 
          the menu.</P>
        <p>Now that you have created a new folder, double click the folder name 
          to move inside of it. Notice the location area at the top:</p>
        <P align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_newFolder4.gif" width="358" height="56" alt="Folder locations on the Save As dialogue box"></P>
        <P align="left">The name of our folder has been added to the right of 
          Documents, indicating that this new folder is inside of the Documents 
          folder. In other words, there is a folder called <b>Libraries</b>, and 
          inside of that another one called <b>Documents</b>. The folder we have 
          created, the <b>My WP Projects</b> one, is inside of the Documents folder.</P>

        <h3 align="left">File Names</h3>
        <p>We now need to come up with a name for this particular document that 
          we're saving. If you have a look at the bottom of the <b>Save As</b> 
          dialogue box you'll see two areas: one called <b>File Name</b>, and 
          the other called <b>Save as Type</b>. The File Name area is where you 
          type a name for your document. The Save as Type means which type of 
          document is will be. Microsoft Word documents from 2007 onwards end 
          with the letters <b>docx</b>. Previously, the letters where just <b>doc</b>. 
          If you sent someone a Word document with the ending <b>docx</b>, somebody 
          with version 2003 of the software would not be able to open your file. 
          Simply because previous Office versions don't know how to handle the 
          newer format. The reverse is not true, though: they could send you a 
          file that ended with the letters <b>doc</b> and you would be able to 
          open it up in Word 2007 or Word 2010.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Word allows you to save documents in a wide range of different 
          formats. Click anywhere inside of the Save as Type area to see a list 
          of the different formats:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_type.gif" width="561" height="292" border="1" alt="The Save As Type list in Word 2007 and Word 2010"></p>
        <p>The image shows that we have <b>Word 97 - 2003 Document</b> in the 
          Save as Type area. The three letter extension shows <b>.doc</b>. The 
          first one on the list, however, is <b>Word Document .docx</b>, which 
          is the one we want. Make sure this one is selected in your Save As dialogue 
          box.</p>
        <p>Now have a look at the File Name area. It should say <b>Doc1.docx</b>. 
          (It might just say Doc1, however, if you haven't enabled file extensions 
          on your computer. If you can't see any file extensions, do the tutorial 
          here on our site: <a href="../BC/win7/file_extensions.html">Enable File 
          Extensions</a>.</p>
        <p>If you clicked the <b>Save</b> button now, your file will be called 
          &quot;Doc1&quot;. That's not a very descriptive name for a document, 
          so we'll change it to something else. To give your document a different 
          name, simply click inside the File Name text box. Delete everything 
          in the text box. Type in a new name, something like <b>Library Letter</b>.</p>
        <p>Your Save As dialogue box should now look like the one below. When 
          it does, click the <b>Save</b> button:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_Save.gif" border="1" alt="Type a name for your document"></p>
        <p>You have now saved your work to your hard drive. To prove that it has 
          indeed been saved, click the round Office button in the top left (or 
          the File tab in Word 2010). Select <b>Save As</b>. When the Save As 
          dialogue box appears, you should see the name of your file in the big 
          white area:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/save_DB_Saved_doc.gif" width="474" height="116" border="1" alt="The new document has been saved"></p>
        <p>Click the Cancel button to get rid of the Save As dialogue box.</p>
        <p>You can continue to work on a document that has been saved. But if 
          you add more lines to your letter, or make any changes, you need to 
          keep saving your changes on regular basis. You don't have to use Save 
          As any more. You can just click the Office button or the File tab, then 
          click on Save. Or click on the circled icon in the image below. This 
          will update your document.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><b>Word 2007</b></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/Save_Word2007_Round_Button.gif" width="184" height="63" alt="The Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, Word 2007"></p>
        <p align="center"><b>Word 2010</b></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/word_2010/save_quick_access.gif" width="124" height="52" alt="The Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, Word  2010"></p>
        <p>A shortcut for saving your work is to hold down the CTRL key on your 
          keyboard. Keep it held down and then press the letter S.</p>
        <p>Remember to save your work on a regular basis. It's not a pleasant 
          experience to have worked on a document for some time only for your 
          computer to break down. When you finally get your computer to work again, 
          if you haven't saved regularly you'll find all that hard work lost forever, 
          with no way to get it back!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>OK, now that you know how to save a Microsoft Word document, let's 
          move on. The next section will be about highlighting text.<br>
