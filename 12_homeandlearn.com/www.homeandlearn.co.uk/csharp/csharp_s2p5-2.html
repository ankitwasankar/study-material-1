<p>As well as storing text in memory you can, of course, store numbers. There 
  are a number of ways to store numbers, and the ones you'll learn about now are 
  called Integer, Double and Float. First up, though, are Integer variables.</p>
<p>First, close any solution you have open by clicking <b>File &gt; Close Solution</b> 
  from the menu bar at the top of Visual Studio. Start a new project by clicking 
  <b>File &gt; New Project</b>. From the New Project dialogue box, select <b>Windows 
  Forms Application</b> from the available templates. Type a Name for your project. 
  Call it <b>Numbers</b>.</p>
<p>Click OK, and you'll have a new form to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>C# Integers</h3>
<p>An integer is a whole number. It's the 6 of 6.5, for example. In programming, 
  you'll work with integers a lot. But they are just variables that you store 
  in memory and want to manipulate. You'll now see how to set up and use Integer 
  variables.</p>
<p>Add a button to your form, and set the following properties for it in the Properties 
  Window:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>Name</b>: btnIntegers<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Integers<br>
  <b>Location</b>: 110, 20</p>
<p>Now double click your button to get at the code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Button_Code_Blank-2.gif" alt="Code for the Button" border="1"></p>
<p>In the previous section, you saw that to set up a string variable you just 
  did this:</p>
<p align="center"><span class="blue_no_bold">string</span> myText;</p>
<p>You set up an integer variable in the same way. Except, instead of typing the 
  word string, you type the word <b>int</b> (short for integer). </p>
<p>So, in between the curly brackets of your button code, type <b>int</b>. You 
  should see the word turn blue, and the IntelliSense list appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Button_Code_int-2.gif" border="1" alt="IntelliSense list "></p>
<p>Either press the enter key on your keyboard, or just hit the spacebar. Then 
  type a name for your new variable. Call it <b>myInteger</b>. Add the semi-colon 
  at the end of your line of code, and hit the enter key. Your coding window will 
  then look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Button_Code_int2-2.gif" border="1" alt="An Integer variable in C#"></p>
<p>Notice the text in the yellow box, in the image one up from the one above. 
  It says:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Represents a 32-bit signed integer</b></p>
<p>A signed integer is one that can have negative values, like -5, -6, etc. (The 
  opposite, no negative numbers, is called an unsigned integer.) The 32-bit part 
  is referring to the range of numbers that an integer can hold. The maximum value 
  that you can store in an integer is: 2,147,483,648. The minimum value is the 
  same, but with a minus sign on the front: -2,147,483,648.</p>
<p>To store an integer number in your variable, you do the same as you did for 
  string: type the name of your variable, then an equals sign ( = ), then the 
  number you want to store. So add this line to your code (don't forget the semi-colon 
  on the end):</p>
<p align="center"><b>myInteger = 25;</b></p>
<p>Your coding window should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Button_Code_int3-2.gif" alt="A value assigned to a C# integer variable" border="1"></p>
<p>So we've set up an integer variable called myInteger. On the second line, we're 
  storing a value of 25 inside of the variable.</p>
<p>We'll use a message box to display the result when the button is clicked. So 
  add this line of code for line three:</p>
<p align="center">MessageBox.Show(<b>myInteger</b>);</p>
<p>Now try to run your code. You'll get the following error message:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/build_errors-2.gif" width="445" height="161" alt="Build Errors message box, C# 2012"></p>
<p>You should see a blue wiggly line under your MessageBox code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Error_Conversion-2.gif" border="1" alt="The error has been highlighted"></p>
<p>Hold your mouse over <b>myInteger</b>, between the round brackets of <b>Show</b>( 
  ). You should see the following yellow box:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Error_Conversion2-2.gif" alt="Error Explanation" border="1"></p>
<p>The error is: &quot;Cannot convert from int to string&quot;. The reason you 
  get this error is because <b>myInteger</b> holds a number. But the MessageBox 
  only displays text. C# does not convert the number to text for you. It doesn't 
  do this because C# is a programming language known as &quot;strongly typed&quot;. 
  What this means is that you have to declare the type of variable you are using 
  (string, integer, double). C# will then check to make sure that there are no 
  numbers trying to pass themselves off as strings, or any text trying to pass 
  itself off as a number. In our code above, we're trying to pass <b>myInteger</b> 
  off as a string. And C# has spotted it!</p>
<p>What you have to do is to convert one type of variable to another. You can 
  convert a number into a string quite easily. Type a full stop (period) after 
  the &quot;r&quot; of myInteger. You'll see the IntelliSense list appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Error_Conversion_ToString-2.gif" alt="Convert ToString Method" border="1"></p>
<p>Select <b>ToString</b> from the list. Because <b>ToString</b> is a method, 
  you need to type a pair of round brackets after the &quot;g&quot; of ToString. 
  Your code will then look like this (we've highlighted the new addition):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Error_Conversion_ToString2-2.gif" alt="The ToString Method" border="1"></p>
<p>The ToString method, as its name suggests, converts something to a string of 
  text. The thing we are converting is an integer.</p>
<p>Start your programme again. Because you've converted an integer to a string, 
  you should find that it runs OK now. Click your button and you should see the 
  message box appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/numbers/Button_Code_int_Form-2.gif"></p>
<p>In the next lesson, we'll take a look at double variables, and float variables.</p>
