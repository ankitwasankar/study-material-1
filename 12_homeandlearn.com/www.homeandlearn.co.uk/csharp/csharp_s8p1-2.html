<p>Quite often, strings of text need manipulating. Data from a textbox need to 
  be tested and checked for things like blank strings, capital letters, extra 
  spaces, incorrect formats, and a whole lots more besides. Data from text files 
  often needs to be chopped and parsed before doing something with it, and the 
  information your get from and put into databases routinely needs to be examined 
  and worked on. All of this comes under the general heading of String Manipulation.</p>
<p>Later in this section, you're going to be creating your very own Hangman programme. 
  The programme will make use of string manipulation techniques. Let's go through 
  a few of the things that will help you deal with strings of text.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">C# String Variables</h3>
<p>You've already worked with string variables a lot in this book. But there's 
  a lot more to them than meets the eye. Strings come with their own Methods and 
  Properties that you can make use of. To see which Methods and Properties are 
  available, start a new C# Windows Application. Add a button and a textbox to 
  your form. For the textbox, change the Text property to &quot;some text&quot; 
  (make sure the text is in lowercase). Now Double click your button to get at 
  the coding window. Then enter the following string declaration </p>
<p align="center"><b>string stringVar = textBox1.Text;</b></p>
<p>On a new line, type the following:</p>
<p align="center"><b>textBox1.Text = stringVar<font color="#FF0000">.</font></b></p>
<p>As soon as you type the full stop at the end, you'll see the IntelliSense list 
  appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_uppercase-2.gif" width="387" height="255" alt="IntelliSense list for C# strings"></p>
<p>IntelliSense is showing you a list of Methods and Properties that are available 
  for this string object you have called <b>stringVar</b>. Here's a fuller list:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/stringMethods_List-2.gif" width="135" height="550" alt="List of String methods in C# .NET"></p>
<p>There's actually one Property on the list. But it's one you use a lot, and 
  we'll see it in action later.</p>
<p>Most of the Methods on the list you won't use at all, and a lot of them are 
  just plain baffling! Some are quite obvious in what they do, though. </p>
<p>Select <b>ToUpper</b> from the list by double clicking it. Because it's a Method, 
  you need some round brackets. Type a left round bracket and you'll see a yellow 
  box appear, giving you the available options for this Method. For the ToUpper 
  Method, there are only two options available:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_uppercase2-2.gif" width="524" height="119" alt="The ToUpper Method in C# .NET" border="1"></p>
<p>You can press the Down arrow on your keyboard to see the other one. But the 
  first one, 1 of 2, is the one we need. As the tool tip is telling you, this 
  Method converts the string to upper case. (The current culture it is talking 
  about is which language you're typing in: a symbolic language like Chinese or 
  Japanese will have different grammatical rules than English.)</p>
<p>The round brackets of the Method are empty, meaning it doesn't take any arguments. 
  So just type the right round bracket, followed by a semicolon to end the line. 
  Your code should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_uppercase3-2.gif" width="387" height="102" border="1" alt="Your C# Code"></p>
<p>Now run your programme. When the form starts it will look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_uppercase_form-2.gif" width="292" height="172" alt="The text is in lowercase"></p>
<p>After you click the button, C# runs the ToUpper Method and converts the text 
  in the text box to uppercase:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_uppercase_form2-2.gif" width="292" height="172" alt="The text has been converted to uppercase"></p>
<p>Another Method that changes case is the ToLower Method. This is the opposite 
  of ToUpper, and is used in the same way.</p>
