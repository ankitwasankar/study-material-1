<p>The only thing we'll do with the code is to write some text to the screen. 
  But here's the code that Visual C# prepares for you when you first create a 
  Console Application:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/console_code_1.gif" width="487" height="444" alt="Visual C# code"></p>
<p>For now, ignore the lines that start with <b>using</b> as we'll get to them 
  later in the course. (The image above is from version 2012 - earlier versions 
  will have fewer <b>using</b> lines) But they add references to in-built code. 
  The <b>namespace</b> line includes the name of your application. A namespace 
  is a way to group related code together. Again, don't worry about the term namespace, 
  as you'll learn about these later. </p>
<p>The thing that's important above is the word <b>class</b>. All your code will 
  be written in classes. This one is called <b>Program</b> (you can call them 
  anything you like, as long as C# hasn't taken the word for itself). But think 
  of a class as a segment of code that you give a name to. </p>
<p>Inside of the class called Program there is this code:</p>
<p class="indent_big">static void Main(string[] args)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">}</p>
<p>This piece of code is something called a <b>Method</b>. The name of the Method 
  above is <b>Main</b>. When you run your programme, C# looks for a Method called 
  Main. It uses the Main Method as the starting point for your programmes. It 
  then executes any code between those two curly brackets. The blue words above 
  are all special words - keywords. You'll learn more about them in later chapters.</p>
<p>But position your cursor after the first curly bracket, and then hit the enter 
  key on your keyboard:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCode2.gif" alt="The C# Main code" border="1"></p>
<p>The cursor automatically indents for you, ready to type something. Note where 
  the curly brackets are, though, in the code above. You have a pair for <b>class 
  Program</b>, and a pair for the Main method. Miss one out and you'll get error 
  messages.</p>
<p>The single line of code we'll write is this (but don't write it yet):</p>
<p align="center"><b>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello C Sharp!&quot;);</b></p>
<p>First, type the letter &quot;C&quot;. You'll see a popup menu. This popup menu 
  is called the IntelliSense menu. It tries to guess what you want, and allows 
  you to quickly add the item from the list. But it should look like this, after 
  you have typed a capital letter &quot;C&quot;:</p>
<p align="center"><b>C# 2010</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/intellisense_console.gif" alt="Intellisense list in C# 2010"><br>
</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Older versions of C# </b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense.gif" alt="The IntelliSense menu" border="1"></p>
<p>The icon to the left of the word <b>Console</b> on the list above means that 
  it is a Class. But press the Enter key on your keyboard. The word will be added 
  to your code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense2.gif" alt="The C# keyword Console" border="1"></p>
<p>Now type a full stop (period) immediately after the word Console. The IntelliSense 
  menu appears again:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense3.gif" alt="The Write Method" border="1"></p>
<p>You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move up or down the list. But 
  if you type <b>Write</b> and then the letter <b>L</b> of <b>Line</b>, IntelliSense 
  will automatically move down and select it for you:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/intellisense_console3.gif"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense4.gif" alt="The WriteLine Method in C# .NET" border="1"></p>
<p>Press the Enter key to add the word <b>WriteLine</b> to your code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense5.gif" alt="Your C# code" border="1"></p>
<p>Now type a left round bracket. As soon as you type the round bracket, you'll 
  see this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense6.gif" border="1" alt="The C# WriteLine options"></p>
<p>WriteLine is another Method (A Method is just some code that does a particular 
  job). But the yellow box is telling you that there are 19 different versions 
  of this Method. You could click the small arrows to move up and down the list. 
  Instead, type the following:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&quot;Hello C Sharp!&quot;</b></p>
<p>Don't forget the double quotes at the start and end. These tell C# that you 
  want text. Your code will look like this:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense7.gif" border="1" alt="The text has been added to the C# code"></p>
<p>Now type a right round bracket:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense8.gif" alt="A round bracket has been added" border="1"></p>
<p>Notice the red wiggly line at the end. This is the coding environment's way 
  of telling you that you've missed something out.</p>
<p>The thing we've missed out is a semicolon. All complete lines of code in C# 
  must end with a semicolon. Miss one out and you'll get error messages. Type 
  the semicolon at the end and the red wiggly line will go away. Your code should 
  now look like this:</p>
<P align="center"><img src="images/c1ConsoleCodeIntelliSense9.gif" alt="Note the semicolon at the end of the line" border="1"> 
</P>
<p>Note all the different colours. Visual C# colour-codes the different parts 
  of your code. The reddish colour between double quotes means that you want text; 
  the green colour means it's a Class; blue words are ones that C# reserves for 
  itself.</p>
<p>(If you want, you can change these colours. From the menu bar at the top, click 
  <b>Tools &gt; Options</b>. Under <b>Environment</b>, click <b>Fonts and Colors</b>.)</p>
<p>Time now to Build and Run your code!</p>
