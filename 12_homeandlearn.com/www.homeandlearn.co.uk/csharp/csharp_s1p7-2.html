</p>
<p>The controls you add to a form have something called Properties. A property 
  of a control is things like its Height, its Width, its Name, its Text, and a 
  whole lot more besides. To see what properties are available for a button, make 
  sure the button is selected, as in the image below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2Button_on_Form-2.gif" alt="The button on the C# form is selected"></p>
<p>If a control is selected, it will have white squares surrounding it. If your 
  button is not selected, simply click it once.</p>
<p>Now look in the bottom right of Visual C# Express, just below the Solution 
  Explorer. You should see the Properties Window (if it's not there, select it 
  from the <b>View</b> menu at the top. Again, 2010 users need to click <b>Tools 
  &gt; Settings &gt; Expert Settings</b> to see the full list of menu items.):<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Window_Button-2.gif" alt="The C# Properties window" border="1"></p>
<p>To view the list of Properties in alphabetical order, click the AZ symbol at 
  the top, circled in red in the image below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Alpha-2.gif" border="1" alt="Click the AZ symbol"></p>
<p>As you can see, there's a lot of Properties for a button. Scroll down to the 
  bottom and locate the <b>Text</b> Property:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Text-2.gif" alt="Locate the Text property" border="1"></p>
<p>The <b>Text</b> Property, as its name suggests, is the Text you want to appear 
  on the button. At the moment, it says button1. Click inside of the text area 
  of button1. Delete the default text:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Text2-2.gif" alt="Delete the default text" border="1"></p>
<p>Now type the following:</p>
<p align="center"><b>A Message</b></p>
<p>The Text part of your Properties Window will then look like this:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Text3-2.gif" alt="Change the Text Property" border="1"></p>
<p>Now press the enter key on your keyboard. Have a look at your Form, and the 
  Text on the button should have changed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Text4-2.gif" alt="The Text on the button has changed"></p>
<p>There's a few more Properties we can change before we get to the code.</p>
<p>Locate <b>Size</b> in the Properties Window:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Size-2.gif" alt="The Size property" border="1"></p>
<p>The first number, 75, is the width of the button. The second number, 23, is 
  the height of the button. The two numbers are separated by a comma. Change the 
  numbers to 100, 30:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Size2-2.gif" alt="Change the Size of the button" border="1"></p>
<p>Press the enter key again, and the size of your button will change:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Button_Size3-2.gif" alt="The size of the button has changed"></p>
<p>You can move your button around the Form by clicking it with the left mouse 
  button to select it. Hold down you left mouse button and drag your button around 
  the form. Let go of your left mouse button when you're happy with the new location.</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  You can also move a button by changing its <b>Location</b> property. Use the 
  Properties Window to change the Location of your button to a position on the 
  form of 100, 50. (100 means 100 units from the left edge of the form; 50 means 
  50 units down from the top of the form.)</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  A Form also has lots of Properties. Click away from the button and on to the 
  Form itself. The Properties for the form will appear in the Properties Window. 
  Change the <b>Text</b> Property of the Form to <b>A First Message</b>.</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  The Form, like the button, also has a Size Property. Change the Size of the 
  Form to 300, 200.</p>
<p><br>
  After you complete the three exercises above, your Form should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c3/Properties_Exercises_Form-2.gif" alt="What your C# form should look like"></p>
<p>When you changed the Text property of the Form, you changed the text that runs 
  across the blue bar at the top, the text in white. You can type anything you 
  like here, but it should be something that describes what the form is all about 
  or what it does. Often, you'll see the name of the software here, like Microsoft 
  Word, or Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express Edition.</p>
<p>We can now move on to some code, though, and then run the Form to see what 
  it all looks like.</p>
