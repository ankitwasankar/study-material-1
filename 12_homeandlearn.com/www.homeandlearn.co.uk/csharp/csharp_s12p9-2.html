<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When you add a new record, you'll want to add it to the Dataset and the underlying 
  database. Let's see how. </P>
<p>Add two new buttons to the form. Set the following properties for your buttons:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>Name</b>: btnAddNew<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Add New</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>Name</b>: btnSave<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Save</p>
<p>The Add New button won't actually add a new record. The only thing it will 
  do is to clear the text boxes, ready for a new record to be added. The Save 
  button is where we'll add the record to the Dataset and to the Database.</p>
<p>Double click your Add New button, and add code to clear the text boxes:</p>
<p class="indent_big">textBox1.Clear();<br>
  textBox2.Clear();<br>
  textBox3.Clear();<br>
  textBox4.Clear();</p>
<p>That's all we need to do here. You can test it out, if you want. But all the 
  code does is to clear the four text boxes of text. The user can then enter a 
  new record.</p>
<p>After a new record has been entered into the text boxes, we can Save it. So 
  double click your Save button to get at the code.</p>
<p>To save a record, you need to do two things: save it to the Dataset, and save 
  it to the underlying database. You need to do it this way because the Dataset 
  with its copy of the records is disconnected from the database. Saving to the 
  Dataset is NOT the same as saving to the database.</p>
<p>To add a record to the Dataset, you need to create a new Row:</p>
<p class="indent_small">DataRow dRow = ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].NewRow();</p>
<p>This creates a New DataRow called <b>dRow</b>. But the Row will not have any 
  data. To add data to the row, the format is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">dRow[1] = textBox1.Text;</p>
<p>So after your DataRow variable (<b>dRow</b>) you need a pair of square brackets. 
  In between the square brackets type its position in the Row. This is the Column 
  number. dRow[1] refers to the <b>first_name</b> column, for us. After an equals 
  sign, you type whatever it is you want to add to that Column - the text from 
  textBox1, in our case.</p>
<p>Finally, you issue the Add command:</p>
<p class="indent_small">ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Rows.Add( dRow );</p>
<p>After Add, and in between a pair of round brackets, you type the name of the 
  Row you want to add, which was dRow in our example. The new Row will then get 
  added to the end of the Dataset.</p>
<p>So add this code to your Save button:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/save_button-2.gif" width="396" height="245" alt="Saving a record to a database in C# .NET"></p>
<p>Notice the last two lines:</p>
<p class="indent_big">MaxRows = MaxRows + 1; <br>
  inc = MaxRows - 1;</p>
<p>Because we have added a new Row to the Dataset, we also need to add 1 to the 
  MaxRows variable. The inc variable can be set to the last record in the Dataset.</p>
<p>Try it out. When you start your programme, click the Add New button to clear 
  the text boxes. Enter a new record in the blank text boxes and then click your 
  Save button. Click your Previous and Next buttons. You'll see that the new record 
  appears. </p>
<p>(Obviously, you'll want to add error checking code to check that the Save button 
  is not clicked before the Add button. Or simply set the Enabled property to 
  false for the Save button when the form loads. You can then set Enabled to true 
  in your Add button.)</p>
<p>If you close the programme down, and start it back up again you'll find that 
  the new record has disappeared! It's disappeared because we haven't yet added 
  it to the underlying database. We've only added it to the Dataset.</p>
<p>To add a new record to the Database, you need to use something called a Command 
  Builder. You use the Command Builder in conjunction with a DataAdapter. This 
  has an Update method that will do the job for you. The only thing you need to 
  do is tell it which Dataset and table holds all the records. Let's see how.</p>
<p>Add the following line to your Save button: (Add it after ds1.Tables but before 
  the MaxRows line)</p>
<p class="indent_small">System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeCommandBuilder cb;</p>
<p>This sets up a SqlCeCommandBuilder variable. We've called it cb. Next, you 
  can create an object from your variable:</p>
<p class="indent_small">cb = new System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeCommandBuilder( 
  <i>da</i> );</p>
<p>Notice that the SqlCeCommandBuilder now has a pair of round brackets. In between 
  the round brackets you type the name of a DataAdapter. We set one up at the 
  top of the code called da, so we can use this.</p>
<p>The Command Builder has its own DataAdapter, which in turn has an Update method. 
  The next line to add, therefore, is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">cb.DataAdapter.Update( ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;] 
  );</p>
<p>In between the round brackets of update, you need a dataset. You then refer 
  to the table associated with the dataset. For us this was ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].</p>
<p>Your code for the Save button, then, should look like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/save_button_2-2.gif" width="441" height="362" alt="C# Code to update a dataset"></p>
<p>Notice that we've disabled the Save button but enabled the AddNew button. We 
  did the reverse with the AddNew button:</p>
<p class="indent_big">textBox1.Clear();<br>
  textBox2.Clear();<br>
  textBox3.Clear();<br>
  textBox4.Clear();</p>
<p class="indent_big">btnAddNew.Enabled = false;<br>
  btnSave.Enabled = true;</p>
<p>You can try your programme out, now. Click your <b>Add New </b>button and add 
  a new record. Click the <b>Save</b> button. When you close the programme down 
  and reopen it, the new record should be there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Update a Record</h3>
<p>Sometimes, all you want to do is to update a record in the database. This is 
  very similar to Adding a new record. Examine the following code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/update_code-2.gif" width="459" height="334" alt="Updating the dataset"></p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that we've set up a method called <b>UpdateDB</b>. 
  This has all the code for the Command Builder and is doing the actual updating. 
  We can then remove this same code from the Save button:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/save_button_3-2.gif" width="396" height="338" alt="Saving the dataset"></p>
<p>Notice the call to our new method:</p>
<p class="indent_big">UpdateDB( );</p>
<p>For the Update button, the first line of the code is this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">= ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Rows[inc];</p>
<p>The only thing you're not doing is adding a new Row. After creating a new Row 
  called dRow2, we set it to the current Row, using our <b>inc</b> variable. Whatever 
  is in the text boxes then gets transferred to dRow2[1], dRow2[2], dRow2[3] and 
  dRow2[4]. These are the Columns in the Row.</p>
<p>When you run your form again, amend one of your records. Close down the form 
  and open it back up again. You should find that your amendments are still there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Delete a Record</h3>
<p>To delete a record from the Dataset, you use the Delete method:</p>
<p>ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Rows[inc].Delete( );</p>
<p>This is enough to Delete the entire Row ( Rows[inc] ). But it is only deleted 
  from the Dataset. Here's the code to delete the record from the database, as 
  well:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/con_new/con_code_3-2.gif" width="407" height="153" alt="Deleting a record from the dataset"></p>
<p>After the Delete( ) line, we make a call to our <b>UpdateDB</b> method again. 
  This will commit the changes to the database. Because we've deleted a record, 
  we need to reset the <b>MaxRows</b> count, because it will be one less. We also 
  need to deduct one from the inc variable. After this, we can make a call to 
  <b>NavigateRecords</b>. The final line just displays a message that the record 
  was deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise P</b><br>
  Examine this version of our form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/form_done-2.gif" width="368" height="456" alt="The complete data entry form in C# .NET"></p>
<p>If you look at the bottom, you'll see a label that says &quot;Record 1 of 10&quot;. 
  Implement this in your own programme. If you set up a method, you can just call 
  it when the form loads, and again from NavigateRecords.</p>
