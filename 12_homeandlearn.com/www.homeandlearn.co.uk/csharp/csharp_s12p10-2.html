<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A useful feature to add is a Find button. When a find button is clicked, you 
  then display the record that the user was searching for. Or display a &quot;Not 
  found&quot; message if there were no matching records.</P>
<p>So add a new button to your form. Set the Text property to <b>Find</b>, and 
  the Name property to <b>btnFind</b>. Double click your button to get at the 
  coding window.</p>
<p>There are quite a few different ways you can implement a search. The method 
  we'll use is to Select a row from the dataset. We'll allow a user to search 
  using a last name.</p>
<p>Add the following three lines to your <b>btnFind</b> code:</p>
<p class="indent_big">string searchFor = &quot;Ata&quot;;<br>
  int results = 0;<br>
  DataRow[] returnedRows;</p>
<p>The first variable sets up a string called <b>searchFor</b>. This is obviously 
  the record we want to find. We've hard-coded the value, here, and just entered 
  a last name from our database table. But you'd want this value to come from 
  a text box on your form.</p>
<p>The second variable, results, will be used to tell us whether or not any results 
  were found.</p>
<p>The third line is a DataRow array, which we've called returnedRows. We're using 
  an array because more than one record might be found. Each record will then 
  be stored in a position in the array.</p>
<p>To get at a particular Row in your Dataset, you can use the Select method. 
  Here's the code. It's a bit long, so we've had to spread it over two lines. 
  It should be one line in your code:</p>
<p class="indent_small">returnedRows = ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Select(&quot;last_name='&quot; 
  + searchFor + &quot;'&quot;);</p>
<p>So you start with your Dataset, which was <b>ds1</b> for us. Then you need 
  the name of a Table in your Dataset. We want to search the &quot;Workers&quot; 
  table. After a dot, we have the <b>Select</b> method:</p>
<p class="indent_small">Select(&quot;last_Name=' &quot; + searchFor + &quot; ' 
  &quot;);</p>
<p>It looks a bit messy with all those quote marks. But first we have an outer 
  pair:</p>
<p class="indent_big">Select(&quot; &quot;);</p>
<p>Inside of these two double quotes, we have this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">last_name=</p>
<p>You need to type the name of a Column from your Dataset, here. We're using 
  the last_name Column. But we could have used the first_name Column instead:</p>
<p class="indent_big">first_name=</p>
<p>The Column names are the same ones we used in our database table. But notice 
  the equals sign. After that, you need a value to search for. This needs to go 
  in single quotes. So if you wanted to hard-code a <b>last_name</b> value it 
  would be this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">Select(&quot;last_Name='Ata'&quot;);</p>
<p>We're using a variable name (<b>searchFor</b>), instead. </p>
<p>The Select method allows you to use other SQL keywords. If you don't want an 
  exact search, for example, you can use Like instead of =.</p>
<p class="indent_big">Select(&quot;last_name Like 'Ata'&quot;)</p>
<p>Note where the single quotes are - surrounding the text you want to search 
  for. Because our search used a variable, we're using plus symbols to concatenate. 
  Which is why it's so messy!</p>
<p>If a row is found, it will then be stored in the <b>returnedRows</b> array. 
  To get a count of how many rows were found, we can used this code:</p>
<p class="indent_big">results = returnedRows.Length;</p>
<p>This just uses the Length property of the <b>returnedRows</b> array. The length 
  is how many items are in the array. If it's greater than zero, it means we've 
  found a match. We can use an if statement to check:</p>
<p class="indent_small"> if (results &gt; 0)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">//RECORD FOUND</p>
<p class="indent_small">}<br>
  else<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">MessageBox.Show(&quot;No such Record&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>If a record is found, we need to get at the values in the Columns. We can create 
  a new Row for this:</p>
<p class="indent_small"> if (results &gt; 0)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">DataRow dr1;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> dr1 = returnedRows[0];</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>We now set up a DataRow called dr1. We want the first returned Row to be stored 
  here. The first Row is returnedRows[0];</p>
<p>Putting it all together, here's the full code for the search:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/code_find-2.gif" width="581" height="413" alt="C# code to find a record in a database"></p>
<p>Notice the line that displays a message:</p>
<p class="indent_small">MessageBox.Show(dr1[1].ToString() + &quot; &quot; + dr1[2].ToString() 
  );</p>
<p>Because <b>dr1</b> is now a DataRow, you can access its data by either using 
  the Column name, or the index number. So these lines return the same values:</p>
<p class="indent_small">dr1[&quot;job_title&quot;]<br>
  dr1[&quot;first_name&quot;]<br>
  dr1[&quot;last_name&quot;]</p>
<p class="indent_small">dr1[3]<br>
  dr1[1]<br>
  dr1[2]</p>
<p>It's up to you which ones you want to use.</p>
<p>But try your programme out. Click your Find button and a search result should 
  display.</p>
<p>Close your programme down. Change the name of the person being searched for 
  and try again.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Exercise Q</b><br>
  Add a text box to your form. Get the name of the person from this text box, 
  rather than using the hard coded value that you have at the moment.</p>
<p align="right"><a href = "csharp_answers-2.html#exQ" target="_blank">Answer to Exercise Q</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  OK, that's enough of databases! It's a huge subject, obviously, and many books 
  have been written on the subject. We've only touched the surface in these lessons, 
  and encourage you to delve deeper. Especially if you want a job as a programmer!</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll take a look at multiple forms.</p>
