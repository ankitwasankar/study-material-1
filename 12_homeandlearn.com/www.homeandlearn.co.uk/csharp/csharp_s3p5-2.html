<p>We've produced a video to go with this lesson. It's recommended that you read 
  the text below as well, though. The video is here:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../NET/video_loops-2.html" target="_blank">Programming 
  Loops</a></p>
<p>Loops are an important part of any programming language, and C# is no different. 
  A loop is a way to execute a piece of code repeatedly. The idea is that you 
  go round and round until an end condition is met. Only then is the loop broken. 
  As an example, suppose you want to add up the numbers one to ten. You could 
  do it like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">int answer;<br>
  answer = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10;</p>
<p>And this would be OK if you only had 10 numbers. But suppose you had a thousand 
  numbers, or ten thousand? You're certainly not going to want to type them all 
  out! Instead, you use a loop to repeatedly add the numbers. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">For Loops in C#</h3>
<p>The first type of loop we'll explore is called a for loop. Other types are 
  do loops and while loops, which you'll meet shortly. But the for loop is the 
  most common type of loop you'll need. Let's use one to add up the numbers 1 
  to 100.</p>
<p>Start a new project by clicking <b>File &gt; New Project</b> from the menu 
  bars at the top of Visual Studio. Now add a button to the new form. Double click 
  the button to get at the code. To quickly add a code stub for a loop, right 
  click anywhere between the curly brackets of the button code. From the menu 
  that appears, click on <b>Insert Snippet</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/menu_InsertSnippet-2.gif" width="383" height="330" border="1" alt="C# Snippets"></p>
<p>When you click on Insert Snippet, you'll see a list of items:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/menu_InsertSnippet2-2.gif" width="473" height="226" alt="The For Loop Snippet in C#" border="1"></p>
<p>Scroll down and double click on <b>for</b>. Some code is added for you:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/Snippet_Code_For-2.gif" width="396" height="123" alt="The Default For Loop" border="1"></p>
<p>It all looks a bit complicated, so we'll go through it. Here's the for loop 
  without anything between the round brackets:</p>
<p class="indent_small">for ( ) <br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>So you start with the word for, followed by a pair of round brackets. What 
  you are doing between the round brackets is telling C# how many times you want 
  to go round the loop. After the round brackets, you type a pair of curly brackets. 
  The code that you want to execute repeatedly goes between the curly brackets. 
</p>
<p>The default round-bracket code that C# inserts for you is this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++</b></p>
<p>There's three parts to the round-bracket code:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which number do you want to start at?</li>
  <li>How many times do you want to go round and round?</li>
  <li>How do you want to update each time round the loop?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that each of the three parts is separated by a semi-colon. Here's the 
  first part:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopStep1-2.gif" width="219" height="62" alt="For Loop - Step One"></p>
<p>And here's the second part:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopStep2-2.gif" width="210" height="62" alt="For Loop - Step Two"></p>
<p>And here's the third part:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopStep3-2.gif" width="222" height="52" alt="For Loop - Step Three"></p>
<p>Number 1 on the list above (Which number do you want to start at?) is this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>int i = 0;</b></p>
<p>What the default code is doing is setting up an integer variable called i (a 
  popular name for loop variables.) It is then assigning a value of 0 to the i 
  variable. It will use the value in i as the starting value of the loop. You 
  can set up your starting variable outside the code, if you prefer. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">int i</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">for (<b>i = 0</b>; i &lt; length; i++) <br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">}</p>
<p>So the variable called <b>i</b> is now set up outside the loop. We then just 
  need to assign a value to the variable for the first part of the loop.</p>
<p>Number 2 on the list above (How many times do you want to go round and round?) 
  was this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>i &lt; length;</b></p>
<p>This, if you remember your Conditional Logic from the previous section, says 
  &quot;i is less than length&quot;. But length is not a keyword. So you need 
  to either set up a variable called length, or replace the word length with a 
  number. So either this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">for (int i = 0; <b>i &lt; 101</b>; i++)</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">int length = 101;</p>
<p class="indent_small">for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)<br>
  {<br>
  <br>
  }</p>
<p>In the first example, we've just typed the i &lt; 101. In the second example, 
  we've set up a variable called length, and stored 101 in it. We're then just 
  comparing one variable to another, and checking that i is less than length:</p>
<p align="center"><b>i &lt; length;</b></p>
<p>If i is less than length, then the end condition has NOT been met and C# will 
  keep looping. In other words, &quot;Keep going round and round while i is less 
  than length.&quot;</p>
<p>But you don't need to call the variable length. It's just a variable name, 
  so you can come up with your own. For example:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">int endNumber = 101;</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">for (int i = 0; i &lt; <b>endNumber</b>; i++)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">}</p>
<p>Here, we've called the variable endNumber instead of length. The second part 
  now says &quot;Keep looping while i is less than endNumber&quot;.</p>
<p>Number 3 on the list above (How do you want to update each time round the loop? 
  ) was this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>i++</b></p>
<p>This final part of a for loop is called the Update Expression. For the first 
  two parts, you set a start value, and an end value for the loop. But C# doesn't 
  know how to get from one number to the other. You have to tell it how to get 
  there. By typing i++, you are adding 1 to the value inside of i each time round 
  the loop. (called incrementing the variable). This:</p>
<p align="center"><b>variable_name++</b></p>
<p>is a shorthand way of saying this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>variable_name = variable_name + 1</b></p>
<p>All you are doing is adding 1 to whatever is already inside of the variable 
  name. Since you're in a loop, C# will keep adding 1 to the value of i each time 
  round the loop. It only stops adding 1 to i when the end condition has been 
  reached (i is no longer less than length).</p>
<p>So to recap, you need a start value for the loop, how many times you want to 
  go round and round, and how to get from one number to the other. </p>
<p>So your three parts are these:</p>
<p align="center">for (<b>Start_Value</b><b>; End_Value; Update_Expression</b>)</p>
<p>OK, time to put the theory into practice. Type the following for your button 
  code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/Code_ForLoop-2.gif" width="392" height="190" border="1" alt="Type the C# Code"></p>
<p>The actual code for the loop, the code that goes inside of the curly brackets, 
  is this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>answer = answer + i;</b></p>
<p>This is probably the trickiest part of loops - knowing what to put for your 
  code! Just remember what you're trying to do: force C# to execute a piece of 
  code a set number of times. We want to add up the numbers 1 to 100, and are 
  using a variable called <b>answer</b> to store the answer to the addition. Because 
  the value in <b>i</b> is increasing by one each time round the loop, we can 
  use this value in the addition. Here are the values the first time round the 
  loop:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopVal-2.gif" width="155" height="65" alt="First time round the loop"></p>
<p>The second time round the loop, the figures are these:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopVal2-2.gif" width="157" height="68" alt="Second  time round the loop"></p>
<p>The third time round the loop:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopVal3-2.gif" width="154" height="64" alt="Third time round the loop"></p>
<p>And the fourth:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/loopVal4-2.gif" width="158" height="69" alt="Fourth time round the loop"></p>
<p>Notice how the value of<b> i</b> increases by one each time round the loop. 
  If you first do the addition after the equals sign, the above will make more 
  sense! (As an exercise, what is the value of answer the fifth time round the 
  loop?)</p>
<p>Run your programme, and click the button. The message box should display an 
  answer of 5050.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a closer look at loop start values and loop end 
  values.</p>
