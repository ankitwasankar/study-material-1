<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="csharp_s6p2-2.html">&lt;&lt; Continues from the previous 
  lesson</a></p>
<p align="left">The Method we set up used the keyword <b>void</b>. We used void 
  because we didn't want anything back from the Method. But quite often you will 
  want something back from your Methods. </p>
<p>What we'll do now is to use the Subtract button and deduct one text box number 
  from the other. We'll set up another Method called Subtract. This time, we'll 
  set it up so as to return an answer.</p>
<p>If you want to return a value from your Methods, you can't use the keyword 
  void. Simply because void means &quot;Don't return an answer&quot;. Instead 
  of using void, we'll use the keyword <b>int</b>.</p>
<p>Add the following Method to your code, either above or below the AddUp Method:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodSubtract-2.gif" width="402" height="141" border="1" alt="A Method that returns a value"></p>
<p>If you add a few comments, your coding window should look like ours:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodSubtract2-2.gif" width="435" height="585" border="1" alt="What your coding window should look like"></p>
<p>So we have one button and two Methods. Before we explain the new Method, double 
  click the <b>Subtract</b> button on your form to get at its code. Then add the 
  following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodSubtract3-2.gif" width="385" height="214" border="1" alt="Add this code"></p>
<p>We'll explain how this button code works in a moment. But run your programme 
  and you should see a message box appear when you click your Subtract button. 
  Hopefully it will have the right answer!</p>
<p>Now have a look at the first line of the new Method:</p>
<p align="center"><b>private int</b> Subtract( <b>int</b> firstNumber, <b>int</b> 
  secondNumber)</p>
<p>The part in round brackets is exactly the same as before, and works the same 
  way - set up the Method to accept two integer values. What's new is this part:</p>
<p align="center"><b>private int</b> Subtract</p>
<p><b>Subtract</b> is just the name of the Method, something we came up with ourselves. 
  Before the Method name, however, we have two new keywords - <b>private</b> and 
  <b>int</b>.</p>
<p>What we want our Method to do is to bring back the answer to our subtraction. 
  The answer will obviously be a number. And that's why <b>int</b> comes before 
  the Method name: we want the answer to the Subtract Method to be an integer. 
  If you want to return values from your Methods they need what's called a return 
  type. This is a variable like int, float, string, bool, etc. What you're telling 
  C# to do is to return an int (or a bool, or a float).</p>
<p>Have a look at the whole Method again:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodSubtract-2.gif" width="402" height="141" border="1" alt="A Method that returns a value"></p>
<p>Notice the final line:</p>
<p align="center"><b>return</b> answer;</p>
<p>This means, &quot;return whatever is inside of the variable called answer.&quot;</p>
<p>But where is C# returning to? Here's the code for the Subtract button again. 
  The important line is in blue bold below:</p>
<p class="indent_small">private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">int number1;<br>
  int number2;<br>
  int returnValue = 0;</p>
<p class="indent_big">number1 = int.Parse(textBox1.Text);<br>
  number2 = int.Parse(textBox2.Text);</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">returnValue = Subtract(number1, number2);</p>
<p class="indent_big">MessageBox.Show(returnValue.ToString());</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>When you click the button on the form, C# moves down line by line. When it 
  gets to this line:</p>
<p align="center"><b>returnValue = Subtract( number1, number2 );</b></p>
<p>it will trot off and locate the Method called <b>Subtract</b>. It will then 
  try to work out the code for the Method. Once it has an answer, it comes back 
  to the same place. We have the call to the Method after an equals sign. Before 
  the equals sign we have a new integer variable, which we've called <b>returnValue</b>. 
  C# will store the answer to the Subtract Method inside of this returnValue variable. 
  In other words, it's just like a normal variable assignment: work out the answer 
  on the right of the equals sign, and store it on the left. In case that's not 
  clear, these diagrams may help:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/subtract1-2.gif" width="398" height="261" alt="Step 1"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/subtract2-2.gif" width="413" height="193" alt="Step 2"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/subtract3-2.gif" width="421" height="191" alt="Step 3"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/subtract4-2.gif" width="405" height="263" alt="Step 4"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/subtract5-2.gif" width="399" height="259" alt="Step 5"></p>
<p>After those steps, C# then drops down to the next line, which for us is a message 
  box.</p>
<p>It can be tricky trying to follow what the method is doing, and what gets passed 
  back. But just remember these points:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To set up a Method that returns a value, use a return type like <b>int</b>, 
    <b>float</b>, <b>bool</b>, <b>string</b>, etc</li>
  <li>Use the keyword <b>return</b>, followed by the answer you want to have passed 
    back</li>
  <li>Store the answer to your Method in another variable, which should come before 
    an equals sign</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing we haven't explained is why we started our Method with the word <b>private</b>. 
</p>
<p>Private refers to which other code has access to the Method. By using the private 
  keyword you're telling C# that the Method can't be seen outside of this particular 
  class. The class in question is the one at the top of the code, for the form. 
  This one:</p>
<p align="center"><b>public partial class Form1 : Form</b></p>
<p>An alternative to private is <b>public</b>, which means it can be seen outside 
  of a particular class or method. (There's also a keyword called <b>static</b>, 
  which we'll cover later in the course.)</p>
<p>We'll leave Methods for now. But we'll be using them a lot for the rest of 
  this book! To help your understanding of the topic, try this exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise J</b><br>
  Add two more Methods to your code, one to Multiply, and one to Divide. Add code 
  to your Multiply and Divide buttons that uses your new Methods. When you run 
  your programme, all four buttons should work.</p>
