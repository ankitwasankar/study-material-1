</p>
<P>From now on, we're going to be creating Windows Applications, rather than Console 
  Applications. Windows Applications make use of something called a <b>Form</b>. 
  The Form is blank at first. You then add control to your form, things like buttons, 
  text boxes, menus, check boxes, radio buttons, etc. To get your first look at 
  a Windows Form, do the following.</P>
<p>If you still have your Console Application open from the previous section, 
  click <b>File</b> from the menu bar at the top of Visual C# Express. From the 
  File menu, click on <b>Close Solution</b>.<br>
</p>
<p>To create your first Windows form project, click the File menu again. This 
  time, select <b>New Project</b> from the menu. When you do, you'll see the New 
  Project dialogue box again:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2NewWindowsProject-copy.gif" alt="A New Windows Forms C# Project, version 2008"></p>
<p>Or this one in C# 2010:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/newProject_Forms_small.gif" alt="A New Windows Forms C# Project, version 2010"></p>
<p>In Visual Studio Express 2012, click Visual C#, under <b>Templates</b> on the 
  left:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/new_project_form.gif" alt="A New Windows Forms C# Project, version 2012"></p>
<p>In all versions, select <b>Windows Forms Application</b> (or Windows Application 
  in earlier versions) from the available templates. Keep the Name on the default 
  of <b>WindowsFormsApplication1</b> and then click OK.</p>
<p>When you click OK, a new Windows Application project will be created for you:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/form_toolbox.gif" alt="A New Windows Form in Visual Studio Express 2012"></p>
<p>The obvious difference from the Console Application you created in the previous 
  section is the blank Form in the main window. Notice the <b>Toolbox</b>, though, 
  on the left hand side. We'll be adding controls from the Toolbox to that blank 
  <b>Form1</b> you can see in the image above.</p>
<p>If you can't see the Toolbox, you may just see the Tab, as in the following 
  image:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2WindowsForm_ToolboxTab.gif" alt="The form without the Toolbox displayed" border="1"></p>
<p>In C# 2010, your screen will look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/toolbox_2010.gif" border="1" alt="A Windows Form in C# .NET 2010"></p>
<p>If your screen looks like the one above, move your mouse over to the Toolbox 
  tab. It will expand to look like the first one. If you want to permanently display 
  the Toolbox, click on the pin symbol:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2ToolboxPin.gif" alt="Click the Pin symbol" border="1"></p>
<p>Notice the Solution Explorer on the right side of your screen. (If you can't 
  see the Solution Explorer, click its entry on the View menu at the top of Visual 
  C# Express.) If you compare it with the Solution Explorer when you created your 
  Console Application, you'll see there's only one difference - the Form.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2ConAppSE.gif" border="1" alt="Console Application"> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/c2WinAppSE.gif" border="1" alt="Windows Application"></p>
<p>We still have the Properties, the References and the Program.cs file. Double 
  click the Program.cs file to open it, and you'll see some familiar code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2WinProgCode.gif" alt="Windows Form - the Code" border="1"></p>
<p>And here's the code from the Console Application:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2ConProgCode.gif" border="1" alt="The Console Application code"></p>
<p>Both have the same <b>using</b> lines, a <b>namespace</b>, a class called <font color="#006600">Program</font>, 
  and a <b>Main</b> Method.</p>
<p>The Main Method is the entry point for your programme. The code between the 
  curly brackets of Main will get executed when the programme first starts. The 
  last line in the <b>WindowsApplication1</b> code above is the one that Runs 
  Form1 when the Application starts.</p>
<p>You can do other things here. For example, suppose you had a programme that 
  connects to a server. If it finds a connection then it loads some information 
  from a database. In the Main Method, you could check that the server connection 
  is OK. If it's not, display a second form; if it's OK, then display the first 
  form.</p>
<p>But don't worry if all that code has you scratching your head. The thing to 
  bear in mind here is that a method called <b>Main</b> starts your programme. 
  And <b>Program.cs</b> in the Solution Explorer on the right is where the code 
  for Main lives.</p>
<p>But we won't be writing code in the Program.cs file, so we can close it. Have 
  a look near the top of the coding window, and you'll some tabs:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2ProgramTab.gif" alt="Locate the Program Tab" border="1"></p>
<p>Right click the Program.cs tab and select <b>Close</b> from the menu that appears. 
  You should now see your form again (you may have a Start tab as well. You can 
  close this, if you want).</p>
<p>To see the window where you'll write most of your code, right click <b>Form1.cs</b> 
  in the Solution Explorer:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/view_code.gif" width="615" height="490" alt="Viewing the code for a C# windows form"></p>
<p>The menu has options for <b>View Code</b> and <b>View Designer</b>. The Designer 
  is the Form you can see at the moment. Click <b>View Code</b> from the menu 
  to see the following window appear (you can also press the F7 key on your keyboard 
  in earlier versions, and CTRL + ALT + 0 in version 2012):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/code_top.gif"></p>
<p>This is the code for the Form itself. This Form (screenshot from version 2008):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2Form1.gif" border="1" alt="The Windows Form in C#"></p>
<p>The code has a lot more <b>using</b> statements than before. Don't worry about 
  these for now. They just mean &quot;using some code that's already been written&quot;.</p>
<p>The code also says <b>partial class Form1</b>. It's partial because some code 
  is hidden from you. To see the rest of it (which we don't need to alter), click 
  the plus symbol next to Form1.cs in the Solution Explorer:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2Form1Designerpsd.gif" alt="Form1 - Designer" border="1"></p>
<p>Now double click <b>Form1.Designer.cs</b>. You'll see the following code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2Form1DesignerCode.gif" alt="The Form1 Designer Code" border="1"></p>
<p>Again, you see <b>partial class Form1</b>, which is the rest of the code. Click 
  the plus symbol next to <b>Windows Form Designer generated code</b>. You'll 
  see the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2Form1DesignerCode2.gif" alt="Designer generated code" border="1"></p>
<p><b>InitializeComponent</b> is code (a Method) that is automatically generated 
  for you when you create a new Windows Application project. As you add things 
  like buttons and text boxes to your form, more code will be added here for you.</p>
<p>But you don't need to do anything in this window, so you can right click the 
  <b>Form1.Designer.cs</b> tab at the top, and click <b>Close</b> from the menu.</p>
<p>Click back on the <b>Form1.cs</b> tab at the top to see you form again. If 
  the tab is not there, right click Form1.cs in the Solution Explorer on the right. 
  From the menu, select <b>View Designer</b>. Here's what you should be looking 
  at:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c2Form1.gif" border="1" alt="The Windows Form in C#"></p>
<p>It's in Designer view that we'll be adding things like buttons and text boxes 
  to our form. But you can run this programme as it is. From the <b>Debug</b> 
  menu at the top, click <b>Start Debugging</b> (Or you can just press the F5 
  key on your keyboard.):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/debug_start.gif" alt="The Debug menu"></p>
<p>When you click Start Debugging, Visual C# will Build the programme first, and 
  then run it, if it can. If it can't run your programme you'll see error messages.</p>
<p>But you should see your form running on top of Visual Studio. It will have 
  its own Red X, and it's own minimize and maximize buttons. Click the Red X to 
  close your programme, and to return to Visual C# Express.</p>
<p>From now on, when we say Run your programme, this is what we mean: either press 
  F5, or click <b>Debug &gt; Start Debugging</b>.</p>
<p>OK, time for you to start adding things to the form, and to do a little coding!</p>
