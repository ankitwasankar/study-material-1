<P>At the moment, we have a Dataset filled with records from the database table. 
  But we can't actually see anything. What we'd like to do is to display the records 
  on a form. We'll put the data in textboxes.</P>
<p>Add four text boxes and four labels to your form, so that the design looks 
  something like ours below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/form_1.gif" width="395" height="260" alt="A data entry form in C# .NET"></p>
<p>When the form loads, we want the first record from the Dataset to appear in 
  the text boxes.</p>
<p>We'll do all that from a method. So just after your form load code, add a new 
  method called <b>NavigateRecords</b>. It's not going to return a value, so you 
  can make it a void method.</p>
<p>Trying to get at the data from a Dataset can be a torturous business, because 
  there are so many properties and methods to access. The easiest way is to first 
  set up a new DataRow variable:</p>
<p class="indent_small">DataRow dRow;</p>
<p>This will refer to a row from the Dataset:</p>
<p class="indent_small">DataRow dRow = ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Rows[0];</p>
<p>So after the equals sign, we have this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Rows[0];</p>
<p>You first type the name of your Dataset, which is <b>ds1</b> for us. After 
  a dot, select Tables from the IntelliSense list. <b>Tables</b> is a collection, 
  and stores a list of all the available Tables (a Table is just that grid that 
  we mentioned). To tell C# which Table you want, type its name between square 
  brackets and a pair of double quotes. After another dot, select Rows from the 
  IntelliSense list. In between square brackets, you specify which Row from the 
  Dataset you want. Row zero [0] is the first Row in the Table.</p>
<p>So add that line to your <b>NavigateRecords</b> method.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of it! We've only pointed to a Row in the Dataset. We 
  also need to specify a column.</p>
<p>To get at a Column in the Row, the code is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">dRow.ItemArray.GetValue(1).ToString()</p>
<p>We've started with our Row object, which we've called <b>dRow</b>. After a 
  dot, select <b>ItemArray</b> from the IntelliSense list. This is an Array of 
  all the Items (Columns) in your Row. We had five columns in our database table: 
  ID, first_name, family_name, job_title, and department. ItemArray starts at 
  zero, so ID will be Item 0, first_name will be Item 1, last_name will be Item 
  2, job_title will be Item 3, and department will be Item 4.</p>
<p>After another dot, then, select <b>GetValue</b> from the list. As its name 
  suggests, this will Get the Values from your Columns. In between round brackets, 
  you need the Item number from the array. <b>GetValue(1)</b> will refer to the 
  first_name column in our Dataset. Finally, you need to convert it to a string 
  with <b>ToString</b>. Once converted to a string, you can put it straight into 
  a text box.</p>
<p>Putting all that together, add the following code to your NavigateRecords method:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/con_code_3.gif" width="424" height="151" alt="Getting records from a C# .NET DataSet"></p>
<p>If you prefer, you can put everything on one line. But it will be a very long 
  line. Here it is:</p>
<p class="indent_small">textBox1.Text = ds1.Tables[&quot;Workers&quot;].Rows[0].ItemArray.GetValue(1).ToString();</p>
<p>But you are almost ready to test it all out. The final thing to do is to add 
  a call to your NavigateRecords method. Put the call just before the <b>con.Close</b> 
  line, as in the image below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/con_code_4.gif" width="418" height="271" alt="A method to pull data from a dataset"></p>
<p>Now you can test it out. Run your programme and the form should display the 
  first record from your database. It should look like ours:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_databases/form_2.gif" width="395" height="260" alt="A record displayed on a C# form"></p>
<p>Now that we have one record displayed, we can add buttons to navigate backwards 
  and forward through all the records in our database. We'lldo that in the next 
  part below.</p>
