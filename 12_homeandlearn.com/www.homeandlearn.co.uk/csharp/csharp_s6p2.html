<p align="center"><a href="csharp_s6p1.html">&lt;&lt; Continues from the previous 
  lesson</a></p>
<p align="left">You can hand values over to your Methods. The Method can then 
  use these values in its code. For us, we want to get two numbers from the text 
  boxes, and then add them up. The two values from the text boxes, then, need 
  to be handed over to our Method. The code to add up will go between the curly 
  brackets of the <b>AddUp</b> Method.</p>
<p>To hand values over to your Methods, you place them between the round brackets. 
  These are called parameters. (You'll also hear the term arguments, often used 
  to mean the same thing. There is a subtle difference, however, which you'll 
  see shortly. It's not crucial that you learn the difference, though!)</p>
<p>Change your Method to this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp3.gif" width="326" height="102" border="1" alt="The method has two parameters"></p>
<p>So we've added two parameters between the round brackets of AddUp. A parameter 
  is set up just like an ordinary variable. You start with the variable type (int, 
  string, bool, etc.) then a space. After the space, you need to come up with 
  a name for your parameter. We've called our first parameter <b>firstNumber</b>. 
  But we could have called it almost anything. If you want more than one parameter, 
  you separate them with commas. We've added a second parameter and called it 
  <b>secondNumber</b>. Both parameters have been set up as type <font color="#0000FF">int</font>. 
  They're going to hold numbers, in other words.</p>
<p>We can use these parameters in the code for the Method. Adapt your AddUp code 
  so that it's like ours below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp4.gif" width="325" height="167" border="1" alt="Change your code"></p>
<p>So we've set up a new <font color="#0000FF">int</font> variable called <b>answer</b>. 
  We're then adding up the variables <b>firstNumber</b> and <b>secondNumber</b>. 
  The result goes in the new variable. The message box displays what is in the 
  variable called <b>answer</b>.</p>
<p>If you try to run your code now, however, you'll get an error. There will be 
  a wavy blue line under AddUp, along with a strange error message:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp5.gif" width="401" height="88" border="1" alt="Argument error"></p>
<p>This error message can be translated as &quot;You have no Method called AddUp 
  that takes zero arguments.&quot; When you're calling a Method into action, you 
  need to use the same number of parameters (now called arguments instead) as 
  when you set it up. We set up our Method to take two values, <b>firstNumber</b> 
  and <b>secondNumber</b>. So we need to use two values when we call the Method.</p>
<p>Here's the difference between an argument and a parameter: It's a parameter 
  when you set up the values in the method; It's an argument when you're calling 
  it (passing the values to the Method).</p>
<p>Change your button code to this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp6.gif" width="385" height="67" border="1" alt="The method now has two arguments"></p>
<p>So we've now typed two number between the round brackets, 15 and 5. The first 
  value you type will get handed to parameter one of your Method, the second value 
  will get handed to parameter two, and so on. The picture below might clear things 
  up, if all of that is a little confusing:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp7.gif" width="393" height="167" border="1" alt="Arguments and Parameters"></p>
<p>So the Method itself has two parameters. When it is being called in the button 
  code there are now two arguments, once for each parameter.</p>
<p>Run your programme again and there shouldn't be any errors. When you click 
  your button, you should see the answer to the addition.</p>
<p>Halt your programme, and change your button code to this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp8.gif" width="464" height="74" border="1" alt="Change your code"></p>
<p>Now, the values between the round brackets are no longer numbers that we've 
  just typed in there. Instead, we're getting the values from the text boxes, 
  and placing them between the round brackets. Note the comma separating the two 
  values.</p>
<p>You can also do this:<br>
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/methods/methodAddUp9.jpg" width="392" height="169" border="1"> 
</div>
<p>We're now putting the values from the text boxes into two new variables, called 
  <b>number1</b> and <b>number2</b>. When we call the Method, we can use these 
  variable names:</p>
<p align="center"><b>AddUp( </b>number1<b>, </b>number2<b> );</b></p>
<p>The values in these two variables will get handed to our Method. But all you 
  are trying to do is to pass two integers over to your Method. You need two integers 
  because that's the way you set the Method up.</p>
<p>One more thing to note, here. When we set the Method up, the two parameters 
  were called <b>firstNumber</b> and <b>secondNumber</b>. When we called it from 
  the button, however, the two variables are called <b>number1</b> and <b>number2</b>. 
  So we've used different variables names. This is perfectly OK, and C# doesn't 
  get confused. All that matters is that you are passing the correct information 
  over to the Method.</p>
<p>You will also want to get values back from your Methods, and you'll see how 
  to do that in the next lesson.</p>
