</p>
<p>Debugging refers to the process of trying to track down errors in your programmes. 
  It can also refer to handling potential errors that may occur. There are three 
  types of errors that we'll take a look at:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design-time errors</li>
  <li>Run-Time errors</li>
  <li>Logical errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The longer your code gets, the harder it is to track down why things are not 
  working. By the end of this section, you should have a good idea of where to 
  start looking for problems. But bear in mind that debugging can be an art in 
  itself, and it gets easier with practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Errors at Design-Time</h2>
<p>Design-Time errors are ones that you make before the programme even runs. In 
  fact, for Design-Time errors, the programme won't run at all, most of the time. 
  You'll get a popup message telling you that there were build errors, and asking 
  would you like to continue.</p>
<p>Design-Time errors are easy enough to spot because the C# software will underline 
  them with a wavy coloured line. You'll see three different coloured lines: blue, 
  red and green. The blue wavy lines are known as <b>Edit and Continue</b> issues, 
  meaning that you can make change to your code without having to stop the programme 
  altogether. Red wavy lines are <b>Syntax</b> errors, such as a missing semicolon 
  at the end of a line, or a missing curly bracket in an IF Statement. Green wavy 
  lines are <b>Compiler Warnings</b>. You get these when C# spots something that 
  could potentially cause a problem, such as declaring a variable that's never 
  used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blue Wavy Lines</h3>
<p>In the image below, you can see that there's a blue wavy line under textBox2 
  (later versions of Visual Studio may have red wavy lines, instead of blue ones): 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/debugging/blue_wavy_line-2.gif" width="297" height="53" border="1" alt="Blue Wavy Underline in C#"></p>
<p>This is an Edit and Continue error. It's been flagged because the form doesn't 
  have a control called textBox2 - it's called textBox1. We can simply delete 
  the 2 and replace it with a 1. The programme can then run successfully. Holding 
  your mouse over the wavy underline gives an explanation of the error. Some of 
  these explanations are not terribly helpful, however!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Red Wavy Lines</h3>
<p>These are Syntax errors. (Syntax is the &quot;grammar&quot; of a programming 
  language, all those curly brackets and semicolons. Think of a Syntax error as 
  the equivalent of programming spelling mistake.)</p>
<p>In the code below, we've missed out the semicolon at the end of the line:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/debugging/red_wavy_line-2.gif" width="178" height="40" border="1" alt="Red Wavy Underline in C#"></p>
<p>Holding the mouse pointer over the red wavy line gives the following message:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/debugging/red_wavy_line2-2.gif" width="197" height="51" border="1" alt="C# Error Explanation"></p>
<p>It's telling us that a semicolon ( ; ) is expected where the red wavy underline 
  is.</p>
<p>In the next image, we've missed out a round bracket for the IF Statement:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/debugging/red_wavy_line3-2.gif" width="159" height="62" border="1" alt="A Syntax Error in C#"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Green Wavy Lines</h3>
<p>These are Compiler Warnings, the C# way of alerting you to potential problems. 
  As an example, here's some code that has a green wavy underline:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/debugging/green_wavy_line-2.gif" width="386" height="130" border="1" alt="Green Wavy Underline"></p>
<p>Holding the mouse pointer over the green underlines gives the following message:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/debugging/green_wavy_line2-2.gif" width="423" height="128" border="1" alt="Compiler Warning in C#"></p>
<p>C# is flagging this because we have set aside some memory for the variable, 
  but we're not doing anything with it.</p>
<p>This one is easy enough to solve, but some Compiler Errors can be a bit of 
  a nuisance, and the messages not nearly as helpful as the one above!</p>
<p><br>
  Whatever the colour of the underline, though, the point to bear in mind is this: 
  C# thinks it has spotted an error in your code. It's up to you to correct it!<br>
</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at Run Time errors.</p>
