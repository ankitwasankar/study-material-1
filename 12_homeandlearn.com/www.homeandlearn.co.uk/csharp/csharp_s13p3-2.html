<p align="center"><a href="csharp_s13p1-2.html">&lt;&lt; Part of an ongoing lesson 
  - first part is here &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn your Form2 into a Change Case dialogue box, just like ours below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/extras/formChangeCase-2.gif" width="257" height="274" alt="A Change Case form"></p>
<p>When the OK button is clicked, we want the text in the text box on Form1 to 
  change case, depending on which of the three options was chosen.</p>
<p>The problem we face is that the text box is private to Form1, and can't be 
  seen from outside it. If you tried to refer to the text box from Form2, you'd 
  just get errors.</p>
<p>One solution is to set up a public static variable, of type TextBox. You then 
  assign textBox1 to this new variable.</p>
<p>So add the following to Form1:</p>
<p class="indent_big">public static TextBox tb = new TextBox();</p>
<p>This creates a new TextBox object called <b>tb</b>. Add the line just under 
  your Form variable, and your coding window will look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/extras/formTB-2.gif" width="419" height="170" border="1" alt="C# code to create a new text box"></p>
<p>Notice that we've deleted the message box code, and went back to the original. 
  That's because we don't need the message box anymore. Delete yours as well.</p>
<p>Now that we have a TextBox object, we can assign our text box on form one to 
  it. In the Form Load event of Form1, add the following line:</p>
<p class="indent_big">tb = txtChangeCase;</p>
<p>(The easiest way to bring up the code stub for the Form Load event is to double 
  click a blank area of the form in design view.)</p>
<p>Here's what all the Form1 code looks like now:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/extras/formTB2A-2.gif" width="444" height="329" border="1" alt="Form Load Event"></p>
<p>When the main form (Form1) loads, the text box will now be available to Form2.</p>
<p>So double click your OK button on Form2 to bring up its code stub. Enter the 
  following:</p>
<p class="indent_big">string changeCase = Form1.tb.Text;</p>
<p>We're setting up a string variable called changeCase. The contents of this 
  new string variable will be the Text from the text box called tb on Form1.</p>
<p>To change the case of the text, we can use string methods for two of them: 
  Uppercase and Lowercase. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">changeCase = changeCase.ToUpper();</p>
<p class="indent_big">changeCase = changeCase.ToLower();</p>
<p>Unfortunately, C# .NET does not have a direct string method to change text 
  to Proper Case (or Title case as it's also know). Proper Case is capitalising 
  the first letter of each word. For example, &quot;This Is Proper Case&quot;.</p>
<p>In order to get Proper Case, you have to reference two System namespaces. One 
  called Globalization and one called Threading. Add the following to the very 
  top of the coding window:</p>
<p class="indent_big">using System.Globalization;<br>
  using System.Threading;</p>
<p>The code window will then look something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/extras/properCase-2.gif" width="277" height="224" alt="Add two using statements" border="1"></p>
<p>Now that we have these two references, the next thing to do is to set up something 
  called a CultureInfo object:</p>
<p align="center"><b>CultureInfo properCase = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture;</b></p>
<p>The CurrentCulture tells you information about the various language options 
  of your particular country. Our CultureInfo object is called properCase.</p>
<p>That's not the end of it, though! You also need a TextInfo object:</p>
<p align="center"><b>TextInfo textInfoObject = properCase.TextInfo;</b></p>
<p>It's this TextInfo object that has the methods we need. We're setting up a 
  TextInfo object called textInfoObject. We're handing it the TextInfo property 
  of our properCase CultureInfo object.</p>
<p>Finally, we can change the case:</p>
<p align="center"><b>changeCase = textInfoObject.ToTitleCase( <i>changeCase</i> 
  );</b></p>
<p>The TextInfo object has a method called ToTitleCase. In between the round brackets 
  of the method, you type what it is you want to convert.</p>
<p>Hopefully, in future versions of C#, they'll add an easier way to convert to 
  Proper Case!</p>
<p>To get which of the options on our Form2 was chosen, we can add a series of 
  if &#133; else statements:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/extras/properCase3-2.gif" width="494" height="307" alt="C# code to change case" border="1"></p>
<p>So we're just checking to see which radio button was selected. We're then doing 
  the case conversion.</p>
<p>To put the changed text into the text box on Form1, add the following line:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Form1.tb.Text = changeCase;</b></p>
<p>Add the line just before your DialogResult line. The full code for the button 
  should be this</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/extras/properCase2-2.gif" width="503" height="409" border="1" alt="Full C# code for form 2"></p>
<p>Run your programme and test it out. Click your button to bring up Form2. Select 
  the Upper Case option and then click your OK button. You should find that the 
  text in txtChangeCase on your main form will now be in uppercase.</p>

<p>The next section of the C# course deals with Dates and Times.</p>
