<p>Programmes work by manipulating data stored in memory. These storage areas 
  come under the general heading of <b>Variables</b>. In this section, you'll 
  see how to set up and use variables. You'll see how to set up both text and 
  number variables. By the end of this section, you'll have written a simple calculator 
  programme. We'll start with something called a <b>String</b> variable.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>String Variables in C#.NET</h3>
<p>The first type of variable we'll take a look at is called a <b>String</b>. 
  String variables are always text. We'll write a little programme that takes 
  text from a text box, store the text in a variable, and then display the text 
  in a message box.</p>
<p>But bear in mind that a variable is just a storage area for holding things 
  that you'll need later. Think of them like boxes in a room. The boxes are empty 
  until you put something in them. You can also place a sticker on the box, so 
  that you'll know what's in it. Let's look at a programming example.</p>
<p>If you've got your project open from the previous section, click <b>File</b> 
  from the menu bar at the top of Visual C#. From the File menu, click <b>Close 
  Solution</b>. Start a new project by clicking <b>File</b> again, then <b>New 
  Project</b>. From the New Project dialogue box, click on Windows Application. 
  For the Name, type <b>String Variables</b>.</p>
<p>Click OK, and you'll see a new form appear. Add a button to the form, just 
  like you did in the previous section. Click on the button to select it (it will 
  have the white squares around it), and then look for the Properties Window in 
  the bottom right of Visual Studio. Set the following Properties for your new 
  button:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>Name</b>: btnStrings<br>
  <b>Location</b>: 90, 175<br>
  <b>Size</b>: 120, 30<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Get Text Box Data</p>
<p>Your form should then look like this:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/variables/Form_Button-2.gif" alt="A C# form with a Button on it"></p>
<p>We can add two more controls to the form, a Label and a Text Box. When the 
  button is clicked, we'll get the text from the text box and display whatever 
  was entered in a message box.</p>
<p>A Label is just that: a means of letting your users know what something is, 
  or what it is for. To add a Label to the form, move your mouse over to the Toolbox 
  on the left. Click the <b>Label</b> item under <b>Common Controls</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/variables/Toolbox_Label-2.gif" alt="The Label control" border="1"></p>
<p>Now click once on your form. A new label will be added:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/variables/Form_Labels-2.gif" height="300" alt="A Label has been added to the form"></p>
<p>The Label has the default text of label1. When your label is selected, it will 
  have just the one white square in the top left. When it is selected, the Properties 
  Window will have changed. Notice that the properties for a label are very similar 
  to the properties for a button - most of them are the same!</p>
<p>Change the following properties of your label, just like you did for the button:</p>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold"><b>Location</b>: 10, 50<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Name</p>
<p>You don't really need to set a size, because Visual C# will automatically resize 
  your label to fit your text. But your Form should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/variables/Form_Labels2-2.gif" alt="Properties of the Label have been changed"></p>
<p>Move your mouse back over to the Toolbox. Click on the <b>TextBox</b> entry. 
  Then click on your form. A new Text Box will be added, as in the following image:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/variables/Form_TextBox-2.gif" alt="A TextBox control has been added to the form"></p>
<p>Instead of setting a location for your text box, simply click it with your 
  left mouse button. Hold your left mouse button down, and the drag it just to 
  the right of the Label.</p>
<p>Notice that when you drag your text box around, lines appear on the form. These 
  are so that you can align your text box with other controls on the form. In 
  the image below, we've aligned the text box with the left edge of the button 
  and the top of the Label.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/variables/Form_TextBox2-2.gif" alt="Control Alignment"></p>
<p>OK, time to add some code. Before you do, click <b>File &gt; Save All</b> from 
  the menu bar at the top of Visual C#. You can also run your programme to see 
  what it looks like. Type some text in your text box, just to see if it works. 
  Nothing will happen when you click your button, because we haven't written any 
  code yet. Let's do that now. Click the red X on your form to halt the programme, 
  and you'll be returned to Visual C#.</p>
