<p>What we're going to do first is to create a very simple programme, so that 
  you can see what makes up a C# .NET project. By the end of this chapter, you'll 
  have learnt the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to create new projects</li>
  <li>What the Solution Explorer is</li>
  <li>The various files that make up of a C# .NET project</li>
  <li>How to save your work</li>
  <li>How to run programmes</li>
  <li>The importance of the <b>Main</b> statement</li>
</ul>
<p>The simple programme we'll create is called a Console Application. We won't 
  be doing much else with this type of application, as this is a book about Windows 
  Applications. Off we go then!</p>
<p>Open the Visual C# Express software from your programs menu. When you first 
  open C# (pronounced C Sharp), you should see a screen something like this (screenshot 
  is for 2008 version, but 2005 version is the same):</p>
<p align="center"> <a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/csharp_2010/startScreen_2008.gif', 900, 650);return false"> 
  Click here to see the image in a new popup window (86K)</a></p>
<p>If you have the 2010 version of Visual C# Express then your screen looks like 
  this:</p>
<p align="center"> <a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/csharp_2010/startScreen_small.gif', 570, 430);return false"> 
  Click here to see the image in a new popup window (37K)</a></p>
<p align="left">If you have Visual Studio Express 2012, your opening screen will 
  look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="#" onClick ="DoPopUp('images/csharp_2012/opening_screen.gif', 1000, 700);return false"> 
  C# .NET 2012 ( new popup window - 40K )</a></p>
<p>When you're looking at this piece of software for the first time, it can seem 
  hugely complex and daunting. The temptation is to think you're never going to 
  get to grips with something so difficult. But don't worry - after a few lessons 
  things will start to feel familiar, and you won't feel nearly half as intimidated 
  as you do now!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">A Simple C# Console Application</h3>
<p>A Console Application is one that looks like a DOS window. If you don't know 
  what these are, click your <b>Start</b> menu in the bottom left of your screen. 
  Click on <b>Run</b>. From the dialogue box that appears, type <b>cmd</b>:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1RunBoxCMD.gif" alt="The Run Box in Windows XP"></p>
<p>In Vista and Windows 7, type cmd in the search box at the bottom of the start 
  menu. In Windows 8, the search box is on the Start Screen page. You'll then 
  see the search results appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/cmd_search.gif" border="1" alt="CMD search in Windows 7"></p>
<p>Click cmd.exe to see the console appear.</p>
<p>Click OK and you'll see a black screen, like this one:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1DOSWindow.gif" alt="A DOS Window"></p>
<p>This is the type of window you'll see for our Console Application. When you 
  create your Windows forms, there's a whole lot of code to get used to. But Console 
  Applications start off fairly simple, and you can see which part of the programme 
  is the most important.</p>
<p>So with Visual C# Express open, click <b>File</b> from the menu bar at the 
  top. From the File menu, select <b>New Project</b> (or click the <b>New Project</b> 
  link on the left of the opening screen in versions 2010 and 2012):<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/file_new_project.gif" alt="New Project menu in C# 2010"></p>
<p>When you click on New Project, you'll see the following dialogue box appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1NewConsoleProject.gif" alt="The New Project dialogue box in C# Express"></p>
<p>Or this one in version 2010 of the software:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/newProject_console_small.gif" border="1" alt="New Console application in C# 2010"></p>
<p>For 2012 users, click on <b>Templates</b> from the list on the left. Under 
  Templates, click on <b>Visual C#</b>. You'll then see Console Application appear 
  in the middle:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/new_project_console.gif" alt="A New Console Project in C# 2012"></p>
<p>For all versions, the New Project dialogue box is where you select the type 
  of project you want to create. If you only have the Express edition of Visual 
  C#, the options are limited. For the rest of this book, we'll be creating Windows 
  Applications. For now, select <b>Console Application</b>. Then click OK.</p>
<p>When you click OK, a new Console Application project will be created for you. 
  Some code should be displayed:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2012/chapter_1/console_first_project_IDE.gif" alt="The Coding Window in Visual C# Express"></p>
<p>As well as the code, have a look on the right hand side and you'll see the 
  Solution Explorer. This is where all the files for your project are. (If you 
  can't see the Solution Explorer, click <b>View</b> from the C# menu bar at the 
  top. From the View menu, click <b>Solution Explorer</b>.)</p>
<p>The code itself will look very complicated, if you're new to programming. We'll 
  get to it shortly. For now, right click the <b>Program.cs</b> tab at the top, 
  and click <b>Close</b> from the menu that appears:</p>
<P align="center"><img src="images/c1ProgramTab.gif" alt="Close the Program"> 
</P>
<p>Or just click the X in C# 2010 and 2012:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/close_program.gif" border="1" alt="Close Program"></p>
<p>Now double click the Program.cs file in the <b>Solution Explorer</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1ProgramSE.gif" alt="The Solution Explorer in C# Express"></p>
<p>When you double click Program.cs, you should see the code reappear. So this 
  code is the programme that will run when anyone starts your application.</p>
<p>Now click the plus symbol (arrow symbol in version 2012) next to <b>Properties</b> 
  in the Solution Explorer above. You'll see the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1PropertiesSE.gif" alt="The Properties option in the Solution Explorer"></p>
<p>The file called <b>AssemblyInfo.cs</b> contains information about your programme. 
  Double click this file to open it up and see the code. Here's just some of it:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/c1AssemblySE.gif" alt="AssemblyInfo.cs" border="1"></p>
<p>The reddish colour text is something you can change. You can add a Title, Description, 
  Copyright, Trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But right click the AssemblyInfo.cs tab at the top, and click <b>Close</b> 
  from the menu. Now, in the Solution Explorer, click the plus symbol next to 
  References:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/csharp_2010/references.gif" border="1" alt="Console Application references"></p>
<p>These are references to code built in to C# (you won't see as many entries 
  in earlier versions of the software). Much later, you'll see how to add your 
  own files to this section.</p>
<p>Before we add some code, let's save the project. We'll do that in the next 
  part below.</p>
