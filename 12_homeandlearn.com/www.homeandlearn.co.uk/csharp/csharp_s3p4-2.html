<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="csharp_s3p2-2.html">&lt;&lt; Continues from the previous 
  lesson</a></p>
<p align="left">You've already met one Conditional Operator, the double equals 
  sign ( == ). You use this in IF Statement when you want to check if a variable 
  &quot;has a value of&quot; something:</p>
<p align="left" class="indent_small">if ( myVariable == 10) <br>
  {</p>
<p align="left" class="indent_big">//EXECUTE SOME CODE HERE</p>
<p align="left" class="indent_small">}</p>
<p align="left"> So the above line reads, &quot;IF whatever is inside of <b>myVariable</b> 
  has a value of 10, execute some code.&quot;</p>
<p>Other Conditional Operators you'll use when you're coding are these:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/operators-2.gif" width="427" height="229" alt="C# Operators"></p>
<p>Because you need to learn these Operators, let's get some practice with them.</p>
<p>Start a new project. Add two text boxes and a button to your form. Resize the 
  text boxes and type 8 as the Text property for the first text box, and 7 as 
  the Text property for the second text box. Set the Text property for the button 
  to the word &quot;Compare&quot;. Your form will then look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/formCompare-2.gif" width="300" height="300" alt="Design this form in C#"></p>
<p>Double click the button to get at the coding window. What we'll do is to get 
  the numbers from the text boxes and test and compare them. So the first thing 
  to do is to set up some variables:</p>
<p class="indent_big">int firstNumber;<br>
  int secondNumber;</p>
<p>Then get the text from the text boxes and store them in the variables (after 
  converting them to integers first.)</p>
<p class="indent_big">firstNumber = int.Parse(textBox1.Text);<br>
  secondNumber = int.Parse(textBox2.Text);</p>
<p>What we want to do now is to compare the two numbers. Is the first number bigger 
  than the second number? To answer this, we can use an IF Statement, along with 
  one of our new Conditional Operators. So add this to your code:</p>
<p class="indent_small">if (firstNumber &gt; secondNumber)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">MessageBox.Show(&quot;The first number was greater than 
  the second number&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p> Your coding window will then look like this (our message box above is only 
  on two lines because it can't all fit on this page):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/greater_Than-2.gif" width="531" height="230" border="1" alt="the Greater Than operator in C#"></p>
<p>So in between the round brackets after <b>if</b>, we have our two variables. 
  We're then comparing the two and checking to see if one is <b>Greater Than</b> 
  ( &gt; ) the other. If <b>firstNumber</b> is Greater Than <b>secondNumber</b> 
  then the message box will display. </p>
<p>Run your programme and click your button. You should see the message box display. 
  Type a 6 in the first text box, and click the button again. The message box 
  won't display. It won't display because 6 is not greater than 7. The message 
  box code is inside of the curly brackets of the IF Statement. And the IF Statement 
  only gets executed if firstNumber is Greater Than secondNumber. If it's not, 
  C# will just move on to the next line. You haven't got any more lines, so C# 
  is finished.</p>
<p>Stop your programme and go back to your code. Add a new if statement below 
  your first one:</p>
<p class="indent_small">if (firstNumber &lt; secondNumber)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">MessageBox.Show(&quot;The first number was less than the 
  second number&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>Again, our message box above is spread over two lines because there's not enough 
  room for it on this page. Your message box should go on one line. But the code 
  is just about the same! The thing we've changed is to use the <b>Less Than</b> 
  symbol ( &lt; ) instead of the <b>Greater Than</b> symbol ( &gt; ). We've also 
  changed the text that the message box displays.</p>
<p>Run your programme, and type a 6 in the first text box. You should see your 
  new message box display. Now type an 8 in the first text box, and click your 
  button. The first message box will display. Can you see why? If your programme 
  doesn't work at all, make sure it is like ours in the image below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/conditional_logic/less_Than-2.gif" width="529" height="258" alt="Less Than in C# .NET" border="1"></p>
<p>With your programme still running, type a 7 in the first box. You will then 
  have a 7 in both text boxes. Before you click your button, can you guess what 
  will happen? </p>
<p>The reason that nothing happens at all is because you haven't written any code 
  to say what should happen if both numbers are equal. For that, try these new 
  symbols:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&gt;=</b><font color="#0000FF"><b> </b></font> (Greater Than 
  or Equal to)</p>
<p>And these ones</p>
<p align="center"><b>&lt;=</b> (Less Than or Equal to)</p>
<p>Try these new Conditional Operators in place of the ones you already have. 
  Change the text for your message boxes to suit. Run your code again. When you 
  click the button, both message boxes will display, one after the other. Can 
  you see why this happens?</p>
<p>Another Conditional Operator to try is <b>Not Equal To </b>( != ). This is 
  an exclamation mark followed by an equals sign. It is used like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">if (firstNumber != secondNumber )<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">//SOME CODE HERE</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p> So, &quot;IF firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber execute some code.&quot;</p>
<p>You can even use the exclamation mark by itself. You do this when you want 
  to test for a false value between the round brackets after if. It's mostly used 
  with Boolean values. Here's an example:</p>
<p class="indent_small">bool testValue = false;</p>
<p class="indent_small">if (!testValue)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">MessageBox.Show(&quot;Value was false&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p> So the exclamation mark goes before the Boolean value you want to test. It 
  is a shorthand way of saying &quot;If the Boolean value is false&quot;. You 
  can write the line like this instead:</p>
<p align="center"><b>if (testValue == false)</b></p>
<p>But experienced programmers just use the exclamation mark instead. It's called 
  the NOT Operator. Or the &quot;IF NOT true&quot; Operator.</p>
<p>Try not to worry if you don't have a thorough grasp of all the Conditional 
  Operators yet - you'll get the hang of them as you go along. But try the next 
  exercise.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise F</b><br>
  Write a small programme with a text box and a button. Add a label to ask people 
  to enter their age. Use Conditional Logic to test how old they are. Display 
  the following messages, depending on how old they are:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>Less than 16</b>: &quot;You're still a youngster.&quot;<br>
  <b>Over 16 but under 25</b>: &quot;Fame beckons!&quot;<br>
  <b>Over 25 but under 40</b>: &quot;There's still time.&quot;<br>
  <b>Over 40</b>: &quot;Oh dear, you've probably missed it!&quot;</p>
<p>Only one message box should display, when you click the button. Here's some 
  code to get you started:</p>
<p class="indent_small">int age;</p>
<p class="indent_small">age = int.Parse(textBox1.Text);</p>
<p class="indent_small">if (age &lt; 17)<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_big">MessageBox.Show(&quot;Still a youngster.&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p>For the others, just add more IF Statements, and more Condition Operators.</p>
<p align="right"><a href = "csharp_answers-2.html#exF" target="_blank">Answer to 
  Exercise F</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AND and OR</h3>
<p>The final two Operators we'll have a look at are these:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&amp;&amp;</b> (And)<br>
  <b>||</b><font color="#0000FF"><b> </b></font>(Or)</p>
<p>These two are known as Logical Operators, rather than Conditional Operators 
  (so is the NOT operator). </p>
<p>The two ampersand together (&amp;&amp;) mean AND. You use them like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">bool isTrue = false;<br>
  bool isFalse = false;</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ( isTrue == false &amp;&amp; isFalse == false )<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p> You use the AND operator when you want to check more than one value at once. 
  So in the line above, you're checking if both values are false. If and ONLY 
  if both of your conditions are met will the code between curly brackets get 
  executed. In the code above, we're saying this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&quot;If </b>isTrue<b> has a value of false AND if </b>isFalse<b> 
  has a value of false then and only then executed the code between curly brackets.&quot;</b></p>
<p>If isTrue is indeed true, for example, then any code between curly brackets 
  won't get executed - they both have to be false, in our code.</p>
<p>You can test for only one condition of two being met. In which, use the OR 
  ( | | ) operator. The OR operators is two straight lines. These can be found 
  above the back slash character on a British keyboard, which is just to the left 
  of the letter &quot;Z&quot;. (The | character is known as the pipe character.) 
  You use them like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">bool isTrue = false;<br>
  bool isFalse = false;</p>
<p class="indent_small">if ( isTrue == false || isFalse == false )<br>
  {</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<p> We're now saying this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&quot;If </b>isTrue<b> has a value of false OR if </b>isFalse<b> 
  has a value of false then and only then executed the code between curly brackets.&quot;</b></p>
<p>If just one of our variables is false, then the code in between curly brackets 
  will get executed.</p>
<p>If all that sounds a bit complicated, don't worry about it - you'll get more 
  practice as we go along</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll have a look at loops, which are another crucial 
  hurdle to overcome in programming. By the end of the section, you'll have written 
  your own times table programme.</p>
