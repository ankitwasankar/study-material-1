  lesson</a></p>
<p align="left">The <b>IndexOf</b> method can be used to check if one character 
  is inside of another. For example, suppose you want to check an email address 
  to see if it contains the @ character. If it doesn't you can tell the user that 
  it's an invalid email address.</p>
<p>Add a new button and a new text box to your form. For the Text property of 
  the text box, enter an email address, complete with @ sign. Double click your 
  button to get at the code. Enter the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_indexof-2.gif" width="493" height="250" border="1" alt="IndexOf code in C#"></p>
<p>The first thing to examine is how <b>IndexOf</b> works. Here's the line of 
  code:</p>
<p align="center">int result = stringEmail.<b>IndexOf(</b> &quot;@&quot;<font color="#FF0000"> 
  </font><b>)</b>;</p>
<p>The IndexOf method returns an integer. This number is the character's position 
  in the word you're trying to check. In the code above, we want to check the 
  word that's inside of the variable we've called <b>stringEmail</b>. We want 
  to see if it contains the &quot;@&quot; character. This goes between the round 
  brackets of IndexOf. If C# finds the character, it will tell you where it was 
  (at position number 3 in the word , for example). This number is then stored 
  inside of the <b>int</b> variable we've called <b>result</b>. If the character 
  you're looking for can't be found, IndexOf will return a value of -1 (minus 
  1). The IF statement in our code checks the value of the <b>result</b> variable, 
  to see what's inside of it. If it's -1 display an&quot; Invalid Email Address 
  message&quot;; If it's not -1, a different message is displayed.</p>
<p>Run your programme and click the button. Here's the form with an @ character 
  in the text box:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_indexof_form-2.gif" width="293" height="238" alt="Check for the @ character in C#"></p>
<p>And here's what happens when we delete the @ character from the text box:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_indexof_form2-2.gif" width="293" height="238" alt="The @ character can't be found"></p>
<p>Note that the first message box displays &quot;@ found at position 2&quot;. 
  If you look at the email address in our text box, however, it's <b>me@me.com</b>. 
  So you might be thinking that the @ character is at position 3, not 2. If C# 
  were to start counting at 1, you'd be right. But it doesn't. When you use the 
  IndexOf method, the count starts at zero.</p>
<p>You can also specify a start position, and a character count for a search. 
  This is useful if you want to do things like checking a longer string and counting 
  how many occurrences there are of a particular character or characters. Or if 
  you want a simple check to see if, say, a website entered in a text box on your 
  form begins with http://www. Here's some code that does just that:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_indexof3-2.gif" width="519" height="312" border="1" alt="C# code that checks a web address"></p>
<p>Have a look at this part of the highlighted line:</p>
<p align="center">webAddress.<b>IndexOf(</b> checkWebAddress, start, numOfChars 
  <b>)</b></p>
<p>This time, we have three parameters inside of the round brackets of IndexOf. 
  The first one is the string we want to check (<b>checkWebAddress</b>). Then 
  we have <b>start</b>, and <b>numOfChars</b>. The start variable is where in 
  your full string (webAddress) you want to start checking. The third parameter, 
  numOfChars, is the number of characters you want to check from that starting 
  position. In our code, the start is 0 and the number of characters is 10.</p>
<p><br>
  And finally, for IndexOf, here's some code that checks a long string of text 
  and counts how many times the word true appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/string_indexof2-2.gif" width="515" height="364" border="1" alt="The IndexOf Method in C#"></p>
<p>The code is a bit complex, so don't worry if you don't understand it all. But 
  it's just using IndexOf with three parameters: the word to search for, a starting 
  position, and how many characters you want to check. The start position changes 
  when the word is found; and the number of characters to count shrinks as you 
  move through the word.</p>
