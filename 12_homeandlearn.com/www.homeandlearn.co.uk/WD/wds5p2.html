<h3>Bookmark Hyperlinks </h3>
<P>A bookmark link (commonly called an Anchor link) is useful when your web page 
  is rather long, and users have to scroll down to read it all. You can insert 
  Bookmark links to aid navigation. When users click on your links, they will 
  jump to different section of your web pages. You can even use a bookmark link 
  to jump to a different web page, and back to the same spot where they left.</P>
<P>There are two parts to the bookmark: The clickable link itself, and the place 
  where you want to jump to. </P>
<p>The place where you want to jump to, the destination for the click, again uses 
  the &lt;A&gt; tag. This time, the added attribute is not HREF but ID (it used 
  to be NAME in previous versions of HTML). You then surround some text or image 
  with the tag. Like this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A ID = &quot;section1&quot;&gt;</b>In<b>&lt;/a&gt;</b> 
  this first section, we'll discuss Links</p>
<p>We've surrounded the word &quot;In&quot; with our destination bookmark. The 
  name of the ID itself, the part after the equal sign, can be anything you like. 
  But you'll use that ID in the Link part of the bookmark. Here's the actual link, 
  the part people see and click on.</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF = &quot;#section1&quot;&gt;</b>Click here 
  for Section One<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>Note that we're back to the HREF attribute. This time, after the equal sign, 
  there is a hash/pound symbol ( # ). After the hash symbol you type the ID you 
  used in step one. You then type the text that people will click on. Finally, 
  you close the tag with &lt;/A&gt;.</p>
<p>You can add a bookmark to another web page, if you like. In which case, the 
  link would be this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF = &quot;page2.html#section2&quot;&gt;</b>Click 
  here for Section Two<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>Note where the hash symbol is now - after the name of a web page. The ID of 
  the destination bookmark follows the hash symbol. There is no space between 
  the two.</p>
<p>The destination link itself would then go somewhere on page2.html. If you had 
  another bookmark on page two, you could have the user jump back to the same 
  spot where they left.</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Email Links</h3>
<P>An email link can be added to web pages, too. When people click on this email 
  link, their Email software will start up. In the &quot;To&quot; box of the email 
  software, your email address will appear. The code for an email link is this:</P>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF = &quot;MailTo:online@homeandlearn.co.uk&quot;&gt;</b>Email 
  us<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>Notice that the link is the HREF type. After the equals sign you have this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment">Mailto:</p>
<p>Mailto is all one word, and is followed by a colon. Then you put your email 
  address after the colon, without typing a space. You then type a right angle 
  bracket ( &gt; ) before typing the text you want people to click on to send 
  you an email. The Anchor closing tag &lt;/A&gt; finishes it all off.</p>
<p>And that's it for email address - quite simple! </p>
<p>Try the email code out in a web page, save your work and see what happens when 
  you view the web page and click the email link.</p>
<p>There is, however, a big danger to using an email link in your web pages: spammers 
  have written programmes called &quot;bots&quot; to crawl the internet looking 
  for MailTo. If the &quot;bot&quot; finds it, your email address will be harvested. 
  In short, it's better not to use the email tag. Much better is to use scripting 
  for your email addresses. For example, he's some JavaScript that does the job 
  better, as the spammers' automated &quot;bots&quot; can't read it:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.write(&quot;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;Center&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Contact 
  Me&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/Center&gt;&quot;)</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.write(&quot;&lt;P align = Center&gt;Click below 
  to send me an email&lt;/P&gt;&quot;)<br>
  var atSign = &quot;@&quot;<br>
  var firstPart = &quot;onl&quot;<br>
  var ispP1 = &quot;ine&quot;<br>
  var ispP2 = &quot;homeand&quot;<br>
  var ispP3 = &quot;learn.co.uk&quot;<br>
  var wholeAddress = firstPart + ispP1 + atSign + ispP2 + ispP3</p>
<p class="indent_big">var mToPart1 = &quot;mai&quot;<br>
  var mToPart2 = &quot;lto:&quot;<br>
  var mt = mToPart1 + mToPart2<br>
  var hrefP1 = &quot;&lt;a href= &quot; + mt + wholeAddress + &quot;&gt;Click 
  here to email me&lt;/a&gt;&quot;</p>
<p class="indent_big">document.write(&quot;&lt;Center&gt;&quot; + hrefP1 + &quot;&lt;/Center&gt;&quot;)</p>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</P>
<P>You don't need to be able to understand all of the above code. But notice how 
  the email address is chopped into pieces with these lines:</P>
<P class="indent_big">var atSign = &quot;@&quot;<br>
  var firstPart = &quot;onl&quot;<br>
  var ispP1 = &quot;ine&quot;<br>
  var ispP2 = &quot;homeand&quot;<br>
  var ispP3 = &quot;learn.co.uk&quot;</P>
<P>The address is them reassembled later and written out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Links to other files (Word documents, ZIP files, PDFs, etc)</h3>
<P>You can place a link on your web page to files other than images and web pages. 
  A link can be made to all sorts of different file types. For example, if you 
  have PDF file that you want to share with others, the code would be this:</P>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF = &quot;MyPDF.pdf&quot;&gt;</b>Download 
  my PDF<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>When the link is clicked on, the browser will see the file extension .pdf and 
  try to open it up. You can have the document open up in a new window by adding 
  TARGET=&quot;_blank&quot; to the A HREF code, just like you did above.</p>
<p>You don't have to add anything special to have people download files like PDFs, 
  or Word documents, or zipped files. Just a normal link with the name of the 
  file after the HREF part will do it.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</P>
<h3>Images as Links</h3>
<p>You can turn images into hyperlinks. The only thing you need to do is surround 
  your image with an A HREF tag. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/about.html&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;nav_icon.gif&quot;&gt; About this site</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/A&gt;<br>
</p>
<p>The result would be this, in the Firefox web browser:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/nav_icons_links_ff.gif" alt="Image icons used with hyperlinks"></P>
<P>However, Internet Explorer will display the icon like this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/nav_icons_links.gif" alt="Internet Explorer and image icons used with hyperlinks"></P>
<P>The icons now have a blue rectangle around them. This is because they are hyperlinks 
  first and images second. To get rid of the blue rectangle you can add this to 
  the IMG tag:</P>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/about.html&quot;&gt; </P>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;nav_icon.gif&quot; BORDER=&quot;0&quot;&gt; 
  About this site</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/A&gt;</p>
<P>So we've set the BORDER attribute to zero. This gets rid of the blue rectangle 
  in Internet Explorer.</P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next lesson, you'll learn about CSS and hyperlinks.</p>
