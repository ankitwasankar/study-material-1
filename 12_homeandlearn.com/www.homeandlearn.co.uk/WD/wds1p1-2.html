<P>Hello, and a very warm welcome to the Home and Learn computer course for Web 
  Design. The software you need is set out below. We assume that you have absolutely 
  no knowledge of designing web pages. Throughout the course of this book you 
  will learn the fundamentals of Web Design. And, of course, you will start creating 
  your own pages. By the end of the book, you will have acquired a good understanding 
  of what web design is all about, and have the ability to take it further, if 
  you so wish.</P>

<H3>What you will learn</H3>
<P>The aim of this course is to get you started designing web pages. It is assumed 
  that you have little or no experience of the subject. During our time together, 
  you’ll learn some new concepts and ideas, most of which will not be difficult. 
  After all, there are billions of pages on the internet, designed by the whole 
  spectrum of humanity: children, adults, pensioners, people from all walks of 
  life have sites out there. And if they can do it, so can you. In fact, follow 
  the lessons carefully and you WILL do it. Before long, you’ll have your own 
  pages designed and ready to be uploaded, there for all the world to see.</P>
<P>The technologies you will learn are HTML, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets. 
  (HTML5 is the newest version of the of the language.)</P>
<P>At the heart of every web page is something called HTML. You will learn what 
  this is, and how to code it. You will also learn the newest version of HTML, 
  which is called HTML5. Both versions are included in this course. As well as 
  HTML, you will learn about Cascading Style Sheets, and will be able to improve 
  the look of your web pages by adding CSS to enhance them.</P>
At the end of most chapters in this book you will see a summary table of what 
you have learnt. The summary tables are also included in a separate document, 
called quick_reference.pdf. This is one of the files that come with this book. 
All the files you should have are detailed below. 
<p></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>What you need to do the course</H3>
<P>The only thing you really need to do the course is a simple text editor. We 
  explain all about this in the first chapter, Anatomy of a Web Page, in the section 
  Software for Writing Web Pages. But the operating system you have is not important. 
  So you can do this course on a PC or an Apple Mac.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Web Design Course Files</H3>
<P>There are a number of files that you will need in order to complete certain 
  sections. Whenever you need a file for a section of your course, it will be 
  explained in the relevant section. The download location is here, under the 
  heading <b>Web Design - New Course</b> (you don't need the downloads for the 
  old course.):</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><A HREF="../downloads/downloads-2.html">Download the Extra 
  Files needed for this course</A></P>
<p><br>
</p>
<P>Once you have all the necessary files, you can begin. The first part is all 
  about the software you need for this course. Don't worry - you'll already have 
  all you need, so there's nothing to buy. Click the link below for the first 
  section.</P>
<P>Good luck!</P>
