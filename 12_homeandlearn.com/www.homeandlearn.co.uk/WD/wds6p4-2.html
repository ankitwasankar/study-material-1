</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The easiest layout to implement with CSS is a one column layout. This is just 
  a series of boxes stacked one on top of the other. We'll have a Header area, 
  a horizontal navigation menu, an area for the contents of the page, and finally 
  a Footer. The layout we'll design looks like this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/one-column-layout-2.gif" alt="A simple one column layout"></P>
<P>As you can see, it's fairly straightforward: Header area at the top, navigation 
  bar, page content, then Footer.</P>
<p>The first thing to do is the HTML. The CSS can then be added on top of this.</p>
<p>Have a look in the templates folder that you download with this course (extra_files/templates). 
  (If you haven't got the extra files yet, the download location is here, under 
  the heading <b>Web Design - New Course</b> : <a href="../downloads/downloads-2.html">Download 
  the Extra Files needed for this course</a> (You don't need the downloads for 
  the old course.) </p>
<p>Open up the template called <b>template_one_col.txt</b>. You should see the 
  following HTML:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/one-col-layout-code-2.gif" alt="The HTML 5 code for a simple one column layout"></P>
<P>There are quite a few tags here that you haven't met before. These tags are 
  new to HTML5, and are not present in previous versions. They are:</P>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">HEADER<br>
  NAV<br>
  SECTION<br>
  ARTICLE<br>
  FOOTER</p>
<p>In previous versions of HTML you just used the DIV tags in place of the ones 
  above. The new ones are called Semantic tags. They don't actually do anything 
  by themselves - they are just there to make things clearer for you (and perhaps 
  search engines). If you use DIV tags for everything, then page code can get 
  very messy and confusing.</p>
<p> Let's have a look at our code, though.</p>
<p>Starting at the top, we have a HEADER tag:</p>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;HEADER&gt;</P>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;H1&gt;Top Header&lt;/H1&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/HEADER&gt;</p>
<P>The HEADER tag is not just at the top of the page. If you look further down 
  the page you can see that we have another pair of them:</P>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;HEADER&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;H2&gt;Section Title&lt;/H2&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/HEADER&gt;</p>
<P>The HEADER tag should be used when you want a nice heading for different sections 
  of your page. Our first HEADER is for some H1 text. Since it's at the very top 
  of our page, however, we could replace the H1 tags with, say, an image to use 
  as a site banner. </P>
<p>Our second HEADER is surrounding a pair of H2 tags. This could be the title 
  of an article that we want people to click on.</p>
<p>After the top HEADER tags we have a pair of NAV tags. These are surrounding 
  an unordered list that we want to use as a navigation bar. Previously, we had 
  DIV tags surrounding our unordered list. Now, it's much clearer what this list 
  is being used for.</p>
<p>The next Semantic tag is SECTION. We have two pairs of these. The first pair 
  are at the top and bottom of the page:<br>
</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/section_html5-2.gif" alt="The SECTION tag in HTML 5"></P>
<P>These SECTIONS tags hold the main content of the site.</P>
<p>In between the first pair of SECTION tags we have an ARTICLE tag. As the name 
  suggests, these are used for when you want to separate an article of text from 
  the rest of your site. You may well have more than one article, in which case 
  you can use another pair of ARTICLE tags. Like this, for example:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/article_html5-2.gif" alt="The ARTICLE tag in HTML 5"></P>
<P>Here, we have two articles on the page. Each pair of ARTICLE tags has a HEADER 
  and a SECTION. The HEADER tags have been turned into hyperlinks, while the SECTION 
  tags are used for the headline of the story.</P>
<p>Save your template as a HTML file. Save it in a new folder called layouts. 
  For the file name, type <b>layout_one_col.html</b>.</p>
<p>When you load the page in a browser, you'll see this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/one-col-layout-browser-2.gif" alt="A browser showing the HTML 5 laid out"></P>
<P>Because we used only HTML tags the page looks quite basic. </P>
<p>One last thing to do before we get to the CSS. Add the following ID attributes 
  to your HTML code:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/one-col-layout-html5-2.gif" alt="Code showing the HTML 5 for a one column layout"></P>
<P>So there are five ID attributes to add, highlighted in bold above. (Incidentally, 
  these can be CLASS selectors rather than ID selectors, if you prefer. Using 
  ID means that you can refer to them in a scripting language like JavaScript, 
  as well as using CSS.)</P>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--

google_ad_slot = "5435567376";
