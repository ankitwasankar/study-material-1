</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So you have your image file, either a GIF file or a JPEG. How do you get it 
  into a web page? You do so with the IMG tag in HTML. The basic IMG tag looks 
  like this:</P>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>There are no closing tags for the IMG tag. So you don't do this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;some_image.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/IMG&gt;</p>
<p>In between a pair of angle brackets, you type the letters IMG (short for image, 
  of course). After a space, you type SRC. This stands for Source and means the 
  location of your image. After an equals sign, you type the name of your image 
  between a pair of double quotes.</p>
<p>It's essential that you get the SRC part right, though. To do that, you need 
  to know about Absolute versus Relative file referencing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Absolute Referencing</h3>
<p>Take a look at this file reference:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">C:\Users\Owner\Documents\HTML\some_image.gif</p>
<p>Starting from the right-hand side, this says that there is an image called 
  <b>some_image.gif</b>. This has been saved into a folder called HTML. The HTML 
  folder is in the Documents folder. The Documents folder is in a folder called 
  Owner. The Owner folder is in a folder called Users, which is on the C drive. 
  This is an Absolute file reference. It points to a specific location on your 
  C drive. </p>
<p>This would be no good on the internet, however. Although you will have all 
  these folders on your C drive, somebody else viewing your web page won't. But 
  that person's browser will try to look for all these folders. Of course it won't 
  be able to find them, because all the folders are on your computer, and not 
  theirs. So the image you specified to use in your web page won't be displayed 
  to anybody else but you.</p>
<p>Another example of an Absolute References is this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk</p>
<p>That's an absolute reference to a web page on the internet. Perfectly OK, and 
  you'll see how to add links to web pages later. But Absolute References and 
  not terribly practical when it comes to you own images and your own html pages. 
  Relative References are much better.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"> 
  <script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
  <script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</P>
<h3>Relative Referencing</h3>
<p>With Relative Referencing, the starting point is not your own computer, but 
  the image file or HTML file itself. With Absolute Referencing, the browser starts 
  the search for the image on the left hand side:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/relative-reference_1-2.gif" alt="Example of an absolute file reference"></P>
<p>With Relative Referencing, the browser starts the search for the image on the 
  right hand side:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/relative-reference_2-2.gif" alt="Example of an relative file reference"></P>
<p>So with a Relative reference, the browser starts looking for a file called 
  &quot;some_image.gif&quot;. If you just put this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>the browser will look for the file in the same folder where you saved your 
  web page. If it's there, no problem; the browser will display the image. You 
  don't need to add anything else, because the browser will stop searching when 
  the image has been found. In fact, the ONLY place the browser will look is in 
  the same folder where you saved your web page. </p>
<p>So with Relative Referencing, if you put all your images and web pages in the 
  same folder, the browser will know where to find everything. And when you're 
  asking the browser to display an image or another web page, you only need the 
  name of the image or web page. You don't need to do this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot; C:\Users\Owner\Documents\HTML\some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>You can just do this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>On a professional level, though, dumping everything into one folder is frowned 
  upon. If you created a folder called &quot;web_site&quot; you would be expected 
  to create other folders inside this one. A folder called &quot;images&quot; 
  to store all your image files; a folder called &quot;scripts&quot; to store 
  any external code; and a few other folders as well.</p>
<p>If you do that, Relative Referencing gets a little bit trickier. For example, 
  suppose you have a web page called <b>index.html</b>. You've place this web 
  page inside of a folder called <b>web_site</b>. You've created another folder 
  inside of your web_site folder. You've called this new folder <b>images</b>. 
  So your file and folder structure looks like this:<br>
</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/folder_structure-2.gif" alt="Folder structure showing an images folder and a web page"></P>
<P>Of course, you will have placed all of your images in the images folder. Now, 
  if you want one of those images on the index.html page, you couldn't do this:</P>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>If you tried that, the image wouldn't display. That's because you haven't told 
  the browser about that folder called images. You would have to do this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;images/some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>The forward slash means &quot;look for a folder called . . . that is in the 
  same folder as the current file.&quot; In this case, look for a folder called 
  &quot;images&quot;. (The current file is index.html, which is where you want 
  the image to appear.)</p>
<p>If you wanted to point to an image that was outside the &quot;web_site&quot; 
  folder, then life just got even trickier still. (You'll see how to solve this 
  later). But as a beginner, if you keep everything in the same folder - images 
  and web pages - then this sort of relative referencing should work:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;some_image.gif&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>In case all this file referencing is not too clear, we'll do some practical 
  work in the next section. (We've produced a video about file referencing, here: 
  <a href="video_file_referencing-2.html" target="_blank">File Referencing Video</a>.)<br>
