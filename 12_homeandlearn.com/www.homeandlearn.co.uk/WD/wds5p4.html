</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>The CSS you have been using so far has been placed in the HEAD section of your 
  HTML code. A better place to put all your CSS, however, is in an external file. 
  (By this, we mean a separate file.)</P>
<p>In a new text file type the following (click <b>File &gt; New</b> in Notepad, 
  if you're using this):</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/external_styles_code.gif" alt="Code for an external sytlesheet"></P>
<p>This is going to be our external stylesheet. It has just one Class set up, 
  a Pseudo Class for the hover style. Underlines are switched off when the mouse 
  is over the link, and the text colour turns red. </p>
<p>The main thing to notice here is that we don't need any opening and closing 
  STYLE tags: you just type your selectors and curly brackets.</p>
<p>Click <b>File &gt; Save</b> in Notepad to save your work. When the dialogue 
  box appears, navigate to your HTML folder and create a new folder called <b>css</b>. 
  Move inside of this folder. In the File Name box, type <b>styles.css</b>. Make 
  sure that <b>Save as type</b> read <b>All Files</b>, if you're using Windows. 
  After you have saved your new document, your explorer window should look like 
  this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/save_style_sheet.gif" alt="Creating a separate folder to hold stylesheets"></P>
<p>When you go one folder up to your HTML folder you should have this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/save_style_sheet_2.gif" alt="Folder structure of a web site"></P>
<p>So that a web page can see our new external stylesheet, you need to add some 
  code in the HEAD section.</p>
<p>Open up your <b>about.html</b> code. Add the following in the HEAD section:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;LINK REL = Stylesheet TYPE =&quot;text/css&quot; 
  HREF =&quot;../css/styles.css&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Your code should look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/external_styles_about_code.gif" alt="Code for an external stylesheet added to a web page"></P>
<p>To link to an external stylesheet, then, you start with the word LINK, after 
  a left-pointy bracket. The other three attributes are these:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">REL=<br>
  TYPE=<br>
  HREF=</p>
<p>The REL stands for relationship, meaning the relationship between this about.html 
  file and the document you're going to be pointing to. REL can take many other 
  values, but only Stylesheet is commonly used.</p>
<p>The TYPE refers to something called a MIME type. For stylesheets, you need 
  the value &quot;text/css&quot;.</p>
<p>The final attribute is HREF. This is the path to your CSS file. It is used 
  in exactly the same way as for hyperlinks. Note the path for us:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">HREF =&quot;../css/styles.css&quot;</p>
<p>The link is in the about.html page. The location of the stylesheet is one folder 
  up, hence the two dots and the forward slash, followed by the folder name css. 
  If our stylesheet was in the same folder as the about.html page we could have 
  just done this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">HREF =&quot;styles.css&quot;</p>
<p>But save your work and load up your about.html page in your browser. Move your 
  mouse over your hyperlink. If all went well then it should turn red, and the 
  underline will disappear. If it doesn't, make sure your file referencing is 
  OK, and that you have your stylesheet in the right place.</p>
<p>Placing all your CSS code in an external stylesheets is much better than placing 
  it in a particular web page, as you can just make changes to the external stylesheet 
  and it will affect the whole site. For example, if your H1 headings are all 
  blue, it could take you many hours of work to change them to red, if you have 
  placed CSS code in all the web pages. With an external stylesheet, you only 
  have to make one change and your site is updated! So if you can, always use 
  external stylesheets.</p>
