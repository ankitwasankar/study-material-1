</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In HTML, elements like paragraphs, images, etc, are stacked one on top of the 
  other, rather like boxes in a warehouse. The image below is taken from a browser, 
  and shows three paragraphs stacked one on top of the other. (We've given each 
  image a border so that you can see them better. Notice that the paragraphs stretch 
  all the way across the page, even though we only have a few words of text in 
  each.)</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/static_browser-2.gif" alt="Statically positioned HTML elements"></P>
<P>Here's the HTML and CSS code for the above page:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/static_html-2.gif" alt="HTML code for statically positioned elements"></P>
<P>You can move your elements around the page, however, with something called 
  CSS positioning. The default behaviour is said to be in a Static Position, like 
  the paragraphs above - in other words, they don't move.</P>
<P>But you can move elements out of the normal, Static flow seen above. The first 
  method we'll look at is called Relative positioning.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
<P>Suppose we want to move paragraph two down the page a little. Like this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/relative_browser-2.gif" alt="Relativelly  positioned HTML elements"></P>
<P>The above effect is done using the CSS instruction <b>position: relative</b>. 
  You then use the properties top, bottom, left, and right. You can use all four 
  at once, or just one, two, or three of them. Here's the CSS code that moves 
  paragraph two down the page:</P>
<P class="indent_small">P.rel {</P>
<p class="indent_big">border: 1px solid green;<br>
  position: relative;<br>
  top: 70px;</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<P>And here's the HTML code:</P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;P class=&quot;border1&quot;&gt;Paragraph One&lt;P&gt;<br>
  &lt;P class=&quot;rel&quot;&gt;Paragraph Two&lt;P&gt;<br>
  &lt;P class=&quot;border1&quot;&gt;Paragraph Three&lt;P&gt;</P>
<P>So each paragraph has a CSS Class associated with it. The second paragraph 
  has Class=&quot;rel&quot;. The rel class uses <b>position: relative</b>, followed 
  by the top property with a value of 70 pixels. What this does is to move the 
  paragraph down 70 pixels, but relative to where it was. So it's not 70 pixels 
  down from the top of the browser window. It's 70 pixels down from where you 
  first positioned it: the top position of 0.</P>
<P>Another thing to notice here is that using position relative moves the paragraph 
  out of its normal flow but leaves a gap where it used to be.<br>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Position Absolute</h3>
<p>Another way to position elements on the page is with absolute positioning. 
  You can use <b>position: absolute </b>to place elements anywhere on the page. 
</p>
<p>Absolute positioning removes an element out of the normal, static flow. Other 
  elements will move up to fill its place. The element you have just removed from 
  the normal flow is now like a free-standing element. (The borders of the removed 
  element shrink to fit the contents. If you want more space you have to specify 
  it with width and height properties.)</p>
<p>Items that are given an absolute position are placed in relation to their parent 
  element. If no parent element exists then the default is the HTML tag. To illustrate 
  what this means, take a look at the image below:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/absolute_1-2.gif" alt="Absolutely positioned HTML elements"></P>
Here, we've placed a paragraph of text at the top, followed by two images, one 
below the other. 
<p>Now take a look at the HTML code:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/absolute_html-2.gif" alt="HTML for an absolutely positioned element"></P>
<p>The paragraph of text has an inline style setting its border to green. We then 
  have two sets of DIV tags. The red ones are the outer DIV tags. Think of these 
  as the parent tags. Inside the parent DIV tags are two inner DIV tags, the blue 
  ones. For each set of DIV tags we have an image.</p>
<p>However, if we were to set the blue rectangle to have a top position of 0, 
  what do you think would happen? Where would it move to? Well, take a look at 
  the CSS code with just <b>position: absolute</b>:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/absolute_style-2.gif" alt="CSS for an absolutely positioned element"></P>
<p>The first thing we've done is to set values for the HTML and BODY tags. We've 
  set the margin to 10 pixels and the padding to 0. This is just so that you can 
  see the images more clearly.</p>
<p>For the relative positioning, we've commented out <b>position: relative</b>. 
  You'll see why in a moment. For the absolute position, we've commented out the 
  top value of zero. The question is, if we take out the comments for <b>top: 
  0px</b> where will the blue rectangle end up? Here's what happens in the browser 
  when we do just that:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/absolute_2-2.gif" alt="Absolutely positioned HTML element"></P>
<P>The blue rectangle jumps right to the top of the browser window. The reason 
  is does so is that its parent element, the outer DIV, has no position set. In 
  which case, the <b>position: absolute</b> of the inner DIV tags uses the HTML 
  tag as a parent. So the browser window is now <b>top: 0px</b>.</P>
<p>When we take the comments out for <b>position: relative</b>, however, here's 
  what happens:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/absolute_3-2.gif" alt="Absolutely positioned HTML element" border="1"></P>
<P>The <b>top: 0px </b>position is now using the outer DIV as a parent. The blue 
  rectangle can't move up any further than this, so it covers up the pink rectangle 
  - it's placed on top of it.</P>
<p>This is all quite complicated. So just bear in mind that when using absolute 
  positioning, you have to take the parent element into account. If you don't 
  set a parent element that uses the position CSS property then the HTML tag is 
  used.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</P>
<h3>Fixed Position</h3>
<p>The final CSS position is <b>position: fixed</b>. This is similar to <b>position: 
  absolute</b> in that you use it when you want to take an element out of the 
  normal static flow. For example, you could have a side bar on the left of your 
  page using <b>position: fixed</b>. The difference is that the position properties 
  (top, bottom, left, right) take the top left of the browser window as their 
  default starting position. Also, when you scroll down the page the fixed element, 
  the side bar for example, will stay in place. So if you have fixed sidebar in 
  the top left of your page it will stay there when the users scrolls to the bottom 
  of your page.</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Z-index</h3>
<p>When you use the position properties you also have access to something called 
  the z-index. This is just the stacking order for elements. So you could have 
  images stacked one on top of the other, each one offset a few pixels. Here are 
  our two rectangle images with a z-index set. The pink one is on top, while the 
  blue one is behind it and offset using the top and left properties:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/z_index-2.gif" alt="Two rectangles displayed using the CSS property z-index"></P>
<p>Here's the CSS code that was used:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/z_index_code-2.gif" alt="CSS code for the z-index property"></P>
<P>The default z-index is called <b>auto</b> and has a value of 0. If you want 
  to position something behind an element, you can use a negative number. If you 
  want to position something in front of other element you can use a positive 
  number. If you only have two elements you can just use 0 and -1. In fact, you 
  can miss out the z-index: 0 altogether, as this will be the default position.</P>
<p> Try not to worry too much about z-index - it's rare that you need it.</p>
<p>One final thing about position properties before we move on: you can use negative 
  number for your top, bottom, left and right values. For example, here's our 
  two rectangles moved off the page to the left:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/css_poss/negative_pos-2.gif" alt="Images with negative CSS position properties"></P>
<p>This is done simply by setting a left value with a negative number:</p>
<P class="indent_small">#pos_relative {</P>
<p class="indent_big">position: relative;<br>
  left: -50px;<br>
  z-index: 0;</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Experiment with negative values for the other position properties to see what 
  happens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the next lesson, you'll see how to use the CSS property <b>float</b>. </P>
