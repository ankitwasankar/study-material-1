<P><a href="wds6p4.html">&lt;&lt; Continued from previous section</a></P>
<P>Rather than you having to type out all the CSS for this template, have a look 
  in the <b>extra_files/css</b> folder that came with this course. (If you haven't 
  got the extra files yet, the download location is here, under the heading <b>Web 
  Design - New Course</b> : <a href="../downloads/downloads.html">Download the 
  Extra Files needed for this course</a> (You don't need the downloads for the 
  old course.)</P>
<P>Locate the file called <b>one_col_style.css</b>. Copy it to your own CSS folder. 
  Then, in the HEAD section of your HTML, insert the following line:</P>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;LINK REL=Stylesheet TYPE =&quot;text/css&quot; 
  HREF=&quot;../css/one_col_style.css&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>This is, of course, a link to the stylesheet we're going to be using.</p>
<p>Once you have inserted the link, save your work and view the results in your 
  browser. The plain HTML page should transform into this: (The colours we have 
  chosen are simply so you can see the various sections - they are a bit garish!)</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter6/one-col-layout-css.gif" alt="CSS added to the HTML 5 layout"></P>
<P>If it's still a plain HTML page, make sure your HREF reference is correct in 
  the LINK code above. Did you copy our file to the correct location?</P>
<p>We'll now go through the CSS and see how it works. So open up the CSS code 
  and take a look at it.</p>
<p>The first thing to examine is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">header, footer, section, nav, article { </p>
<p class="indent_big">display: block;</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<P>We're setting up a rule that will apply to all five items in out HTML code. 
  Notice how all five items are separated by commas. You can do this kind of thing 
  for other CSS selectors as well. For example, if you wanted to reset the CSS 
  to browser defaults, you can do this:</P>
<P class="indent_small">body, h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li, {</P>
<p class="indent_big">border:0;<br>
  margin:0;<br>
  padding:0;</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<P>The reason you'd want to reset like this is because different browser have 
  different default values. You'd then set your own values that override the defaults. 
  For more information on resetting, see these pages:</P>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/04/18/reset-reasoning/<br>
  http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/<br>
  http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/</p>
<p>But in our code, we're just making sure that older browsers deal with our newer 
  HTML5 elements correctly.</p>
<p>Next in our CSS code, we set up some general rules for everything between the 
  two BODY tags:</p>
<P class="indent_small">BODY {</P>
<p class="indent_big">margin: 0 auto; <br>
  width: 940px; <br>
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
  font-size: 13px;</p>
<p class="indent_small">}</p>
<P>The first line deals with the margins, setting them to zero, Notice the auto 
  part, though. What this does is to centre everything on the page.</P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  Delete auto from your CSS code in the BODY selector. Save and refresh the page 
  in your browser. Put auto back in when you're finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're doing three other things for the BODY tag: setting a width of 940 pixels, 
  setting the font family, and setting the font size. Play around with these values 
  and see what happens.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</P>
<h3>Fixed Sizing versus Liquid Sizing</h3>
<p>We've specified a fixed size of 940 pixels in our code. There is a problem 
  with this, however. Suppose you want your site to be viewed not only on a monitor 
  attached to a computer but also on a mobile phone. The fixed size means it will 
  be too wide on the phone. The alternative is fluid sizing.</p>
<p>With fluid sizing, the values are not in pixels but in percentages. For example, 
  instead of specifying a value of 940 pixels, we could have written something 
  like 80%. If you are targeting more than one platform then go for percentages 
  for your values, especially for widths (heights can stay on pixels, though).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we'll look at the styling for the HTML5 tags.</p>
