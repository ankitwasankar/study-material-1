<SECTION ID="Wrapper"> <ARTICLE> <HEADER> 
<H1 ID="Article">HTML Tags</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>HTML is written in something called tags. Tags come in pairs, an opening one 
  and a closing one. The first pair of tags we’ll write are the HTML tags themselves. 
  You put one HTML tag at the top, and one at the bottom:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;HTML&gt;</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;/HTML&gt;</P>
<P>This tells a browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox that the code is HyperText 
  Markup Language.</P>
<P>Two things to notice here. One, that the word HTML is surrounded by angle brackets 
  (the Less Than and Greater Than keys on your keyboard); and two that the second 
  Tag has a forward slash before the HTML.</P>
<P>All your tags must be surrounded by the angle brackets < >. This tells the 
  browser that there is some HTML code that needs executing, and that it is not 
  to be shown on the web page. Miss an angle bracket out and it can really mess 
  up your web page.</P>
<P>So add those two tags to your text editor and it will look like this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><IMG SRC="images/chapter1/notepad_html_tags-2.gif" ALT="Notepad showing HTML tags"></P>
<P>The first Tag tells the browser to start doing something; the second tag tells 
  the browser to stop doing it. The stop symbol is that forward slash. So miss 
  that out and, again, your web page can really be messed up.</P>
<P>The next pair of tags are the HEAD tags: They go between the two HTML ones:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;HTML&gt;</P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;HEAD&gt;</P>
<P class="indent_big">&lt;/HEAD&gt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;/HTML&gt;</P>
<P>Again, notice that both the HEAD tags are surrounded by angle brackets, and 
  there is a forward slash before the final one &lt;/HEAD&gt;.</P>
<P>The HEAD section of HTML page is where you put special instructions for the 
  browser. Your browser will not print directly to a web page when things are 
  inserted into the HEAD section. For example, if you wanted to display the words 
  “Hello World” on your page, and you typed them in between the two HEAD tags, 
  then the Browser would just ignore them. That’s because “Hello World” is direct 
  text, and not a special instruction that the browser can understand.</P>
<P>A special instruction your browser can understand is the TITLE tag:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment">&lt;TITLE&gt; &lt;/TITLE&gt;</P>
<P>The Title tag always goes in the HEAD section of the HTML skeleton.</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><IMG SRC="images/chapter1/html_basic_tags-2.gif" ALT="Notepad showing HTML HEAD and TITLE tags"></P>
<P>The TITLE tag doesn’t do very much. And it definitely should not be confused 
  with the name of your web page. If you saved your web page as <B>MyFamily.html</B> 
  then that would have no bearing on or relationship with the TITLE tag. Whatever 
  you type between the two TITLE tags is what appears at the very top of your 
  browser window. And that’s it, that’s all it does. (You’ll see what it looks 
  like in a moment.)</P>
<P>The final, and most important part, of the HTML skeleton is the BODY section.</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><IMG SRC="images/chapter1/html_basic_tags_full-2.gif" ALT="Notepad showing HTML BODY tags"></P>
<P>In between those two BODY tags is where you’ll write most of your HTML code. 
  Think of the BODY as the white page in Word Processing. When you type something 
  in your word processing software, it is immediately displayed. Similarly, when 
  you type something between the two BODY tags and then view the results in a 
  browser, whatever you typed will be displayed. As long as it’s not a tag, your 
  browser will try to display it for you. So remember: if you want people to see 
  it, put it between the BODY tags.</P>
<P>In your text editor, then, add the following:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><IMG SRC="images/chapter1/notepad_skeleton_tags-2.gif" ALT="Notepad showing all basic HTML tags"></P>
<P>Notice that we’ve added some text between the two TITLE tags: <B>My First Page</B>. 
  We’ve also used indenting, but this is only for readability: the indenting doesn’t 
  have any effect on the results.</P>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_Design_Middle */
google_ad_slot = "5435567376";
google_ad_width = 336;
google_ad_height = 280;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"

</script>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>DOCTYPE</H3>
<P>One special tag is DOCTYPE. It's not really a HTML tag, but an instruction 
  to the browser about which version of HTML is allowed. In version of HTML prior 
  to HTML 5 the DOCTYPE could be very messy. In HTML 5, however, it's just this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</P>
<P>DOCTYPE needs to go at the very top of the page. There is no end tag for DOCTYPE. 
  Note the exclamation mark after the first angle bracket, and the space between 
  DOCTYPE and HTML.</P>
<P>So add a DOCTYPE to the top of your page. Your text editor will look something 
  like this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><IMG SRC="images/chapter1/doctype-2.gif" ALT="Notepad showing DOCTYPE tag"></P>
<P>Coming up next, we'll take a look at how to save your web pages.</P>
