</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>Hyperlinks are the backbone of the Web. They provide a means to connect one 
  piece of information (a web page, for example) to another piece of information. 
  If you have designed two web pages, a hyperlink will provide a way to jump from 
  one page to the other. If you have one long web page, a hyperlink can be used 
  as a bookmark to help people jump from one part of the page to another, and 
  back again. This is what a hyperlink looks like (the blue underlined text):</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/hyperlink.gif" alt="An example of a HTML hyperlink"></P>
<P>But let's discuss what happens when the link is clicked on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>What is a Hyperlink?</h3>
<p>When you click a hyperlink to another website (assuming you are connected to 
  the internet), this is what happens.</p>
<p>Your browser gathers the information about the link and sends the request to 
  something called a naming server. The naming server translates the link text 
  (www.homeandlearn.co.uk, for example) into a series of numbers. These numbers 
  are called the IP address. These are needed because computers don't speak in 
  a written language. So the computer needs something it can understand. An IP 
  address is a set of four numbers separated by full stops (IP version 4). Each 
  set of numbers is between 0 and 255. So when you click the link, the text address 
  will be translated into an IP address, something like 213.209.156.97.</p>
<p>The IP address will be used to identify a particular computer. If the computer, 
  usually the naming server, doesn't have the address in its database, it will 
  pass the address further up the naming server food chain. If no naming server 
  can find the IP address, the failure is passed back down to your browser. At 
  this stage you'll probably see a 404 error message. </p>
<p>If the address is found, however, the IP address is sent to your browser. The 
  browser then contacts the web server that has the web page you requested. The 
  page is then sent to your browser. However, that's not the end because requests 
  are done one at a time. If the web page has images, the browser will see this 
  and then request that the images be brought back to the web page as well. One 
  image at a time.</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Uniform Resource Locator</h3>
<P>A uniform resource locator, or URL, is commonly called an address. The URL 
  of our web Page is http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/. Let's break this down a bit.</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/hyperlink_protocol.gif" alt="The protocol part of a web address"></P>
<P> <b>http://</b><BR>
  http stands for hypertext transfer protocol. A protocol is a set of standards 
  that one computer uses to speak to another. There are quite a lot of different 
  protocols. For web communications, the two most common protocols are hypertext 
  transfer protocol and file transfer protocol (FTP). There’s another layer of 
  protocols underneath this called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
  (TCP/IP). The http in a web address is followed by a colon and two forward slashes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/hyperlink_domain.gif" alt="The Domain Name part of a web address"></P>
<P> <b>www.homeandlearn.co.uk</b><BR>
  This is the Domain Name, the part that gets translated into an IP address. The 
  domain name is split into three parts, separated by full stops: </P>
<P class="indent_small_no_bold"> <b>www</b> The host name<BR>
  <b>homeandlearn</b> The enterprise domain name<BR>
  <b>co.uk </b>The top-level internet domain name. Others are .com (commercial), 
  .org (organisation), .gov (government) </P>
<P class="TextAlignment">&nbsp;</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/hyperlink_default.gif" alt="The default forward slash part of a web address"></P>
<P> <b>/</b><BR>
  If no html page is specified, the forward slash tells the server to look for 
  the default web page. This is usually index.html. The index.html page is one 
  that you have created. That’s why naming the first page of your internet site 
  index.html is so important.</P>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"

</script>
</P>
<h3>The index.html Page</h3>
<P>Your web site will probably have lots of individual web pages. Suppose somebody 
  comes to your site for the first time. How does the browser know which of your 
  many pages to load first? After all, your visitor may well have just typed this 
  in the address bar:</P>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">www.homeandlearn.co.uk</p>
<p>The answer to the question is - &quot;default page&quot;. When you buy web 
  space with a web hosting company, you are given a folder to upload all your 
  files. The hosting company will have already specified a default web page for 
  that folder. This is usually index.html. So if somebody types the above address, 
  the browser will look for the default page. You don't have to type this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">www.homeandlearn.co.uk/index.html</p>
<p>The browser already knows to serve up the default page. If you haven't uploaded 
  a page called index.html then your visitors may well get an error page when 
  going to your site. So it's important that you have a web page called index.html, 
  as this is the first page on your site your visitors will see when typing your 
  domain name into the browser's address bar.<br>
</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>OK, we've learnt what a link is, and what happens when you click one, but let's 
  see how to create them.</P>
