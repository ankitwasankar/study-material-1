<H1 ID="Article">HTML 5 Video and Audio</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> HTML5 introduced a new tag for videos. To insert a video into 
your web page you can now do this: 
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;VIDEO SRC=&quot;your_video.mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;/VIDEO&gt;</p>
<p>This simplifies things greatly, as previously you had to use the OBJECT and 
  PARAM tags. Even with a YouTube video that code would look messy:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;object width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/your_ref&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br>
  &lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br>
  &lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br>
  &lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/your_ref_here&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; 
  allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;&quot; 
  height=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;<br>
  &lt;/object&gt;</p>
<p>However, Google does produce the code for you, and all you need to do is copy 
  and paste it.</p>
<p>Another alternative for video is Flash. Unfortunately, not all browsers support 
  Flash (Apple's Safari in particular.) Even for those that do, you need a plugin 
  to watch the video.</p>
<p>So the VIDEO tag in HTML5 was meant to allow all browsers to display your videos. 
  At the time of writing, though, different browsers support different video formats. 
  Older browsers won't recognize the VIDEO tag at all. With those caveats in place, 
  let's take a further look at the video tag.</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Video Formats and Codecs</h3>
<P>The most popular video formats are MP4 (MPEG4), FLV (Flash), OGG and AVI. A 
  newer format is WebM. But these file endings, .mp4, .flv, .ogv, .avi, and WebM, 
  are not actually a single file. They are known as container files. That's because 
  a video is a combination of separate files, such as the video itself and sound 
  tracks. There will also be files for synchronising the video with the sound, 
  the aspect ratio, the language, video title, and a whole lot more.</P>
<p>The moving images part of the video will be encoded using programming code 
  known as an algorithm. This algorithm is called the video codec. A video player 
  decodes this algorithm (codec) and displays the moving images on your screen. 
  There are quite a lot of video codecs out there, but the most popular are H.264, 
  Theora, and Google's VP8.</p>
<p>As well as video codecs there are also separate audio codecs. The audio codec 
  that just about everybody has heard of is MP3 (short for MPEG 1, Audio Layer 
  3). Others are Apple's AAC, and Vorbis.</p>
<p>(It must be pointed out that MP4 and MP3 are patent protected. You are usually 
  allowed to produce video and audio files in these formats because a vendor (Microsoft, 
  Apple, etc) has already paid for the right to use the encoder and decoder software.)</p>
<p>With all these different video and audio combinations, you won't be surprised 
  to learn that browser support is patchy. For example, if you wanted to show 
  a Flash video then people who have Macs, iPhones, and iPads won't be able to 
  see it.</p>
<P>Browser patchiness is the reason why the new VIDEO tag takes a sub-tag called 
  SOURCE. The SOURCE sub-tag lets you specify more than one container format. 
  Take a look at this example:</P>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;VIDEO&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;my_video.mp4&quot; TYPE='video/mp4; 
  codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&quot;'&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;my_video.webm&quot; TYPE='video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8, 
  vorbis&quot;'&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;my_video.ogv&quot; TYPE='video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, 
  vorbis&quot;'&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/VIDEO&gt;</p>
<p>The VIDEO tag is now by itself. Between the two VIDEO tags, however, we have 
  three SOURCE tags. After the word SOURCE you need a SRC attribute. This is the 
  name and location of your video. Notice that the MP4 format comes first. This 
  is to cater to your iPad users. If it's not top of the list then iPad just bails 
  out - it only recognises one SOURCE tag. Newer version of the iPad may well 
  correct this bug.</p>
<p>Notice the TYPE attribute above, though. It is split in to three parts:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment">TYPE='video/mp4; codecs=<b>&quot;</b>avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2<b>&quot;</b> 
  '</p>
<p>You need the type of video it is (video/mp4, in this case). After a semi colon 
  you then specify the codecs. The video codec comes first, followed by the audio 
  codec. The two are separated by a comma. The quotation marks are need. The TYPE 
  above is surrounded by single quotes, one at the start and one at the end. The 
  codecs need their own quote marks, which are double quotes above. You can do 
  it the other way round, though:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment">TYPE=&quot;video/mp4; codecs=<b>'</b>avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2<b>'</b> 
  &quot;</p>
<p>In the line above double quotes are on the outside and single quotes on the 
  inside.</p>
<p>For more information on the VIDEO tag, see this page:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html" target="_blank">http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html</a></p>
<p>Video can be a very complicated subject. If you don't want to go to all the 
  trouble, then YouTube can convert your videos and provide the code to copy and 
  paste into your web page.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"> 
  <script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";

google_ad_height = 60;

<h3>HTML 5 AUDIO</h3>
<P>If you only want sound, and no video, then the new AUDIO tag is the one to 
  use. The HTML is similar to the VIDEO tags, in that you specify a list of audio 
  file formats. For example, take a look at the following code:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;AUDIO&gt;</P>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.mp3&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.ogg&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.wav&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/AUDIO&gt;</p>
<P>Between the two AUDIO tags we have three SOURCE tags like before. This time, 
  however, you don't need any codec information. The browser will try to play 
  the first song on the list above. If the format is not supported, then it will 
  try to play the second song.</P>
<p>You can add some attributes to the AUDIO tag:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">AUTOPLAY<br>
  LOOP<br>
  CONTROLS<br>
  PRELOAD</p>
<p>AUTOPLAY takes the value true or false. Setting AUTOPLAY to true means the 
  song would start playing by itself in the browser, which can be annoying. LOOP 
  means that the song will start all over again after it has finished. Again, 
  the values true and false can be used. Using the CONTROLS attribute with a value 
  of true will get you the browser's in-built audio controls. They look like this 
  in Internet Explorer 9:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter9/audio_controls_ie9-2.gif" alt="Audio controls in a browser"></p>
<P>The PRELOAD attribute takes three values: none, auto, and metadata. PRELOAD 
  refers to the audio file itself. When you set it to none the browser won't preload 
  the file at all. Set it to auto and the browser will decide for you, whereas 
  a setting of metadata will load things like song title, album, artist, etc.</P>
<p>Here's an example of the AUDIO attributes:</p>
<P class="indent_small_no_bold">&lt;AUDIO <b>AUTOPLAY =&quot;false&quot; LOOP=&quot;false&quot; 
  CONTROLS=&quot;true&quot; PRELOAD=&quot;auto&quot;</b>&gt;</P>
<p class="indent_big_no_bold">&lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.mp3&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.ogg&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.wav&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">&lt;/AUDIO&gt;</p>
<p>If you tried the above code in Firefox then the Ogg file format would play, 
  because Firefox doesn't support the MP3 format, due to licensing issues.</p>
<p>For browsers that don't support the AUDIO tag at all, then you can add some 
  text to the above code:</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">&lt;AUDIO AUTOPLAY =&quot;false&quot; LOOP=&quot;false&quot; 
  CONTROLS=&quot;true&quot; PRELOAD=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;</P>
<P class="indent_big_no_bold"> &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.mp3&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.ogg&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;SOURCE SRC=&quot;your_audio.wav&quot;&gt;<br>
  <b>YOUR BROWSER DOESN'T SUPPORT THE AUDIO TAG.</b></p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">&lt;/AUDIO&gt;</p>
<p>The point about the AUDIO and VIDEO tags, however, is that they work in the 
  browser and don't need the end-user to download any third-party plugins. Here's 
  a summary of the new tags used in this chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next lesson, you'll take a brief look at the HTML 5 canvas tag.</p>
