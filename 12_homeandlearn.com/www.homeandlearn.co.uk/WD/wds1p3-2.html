</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In this section, you’re going to learn just what a web page is and how it can 
  be read by a browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox. You’ll also construct 
  your very first web page. Let’s make a start.</P>
<P>Files on your computer come with extensions. If you wrote a letter using Microsoft 
  Word and saved it with the name “MyLetter”, the software would add four letters 
  to the file name (three in older versions). Because it was typed using Word, 
  the four letters that get added to your filename are <B>.docx</B>. So your file 
  name will be “MyLetter.docx” and not just “MyLetter”. If you created a spreadsheet 
  in Microsoft Excel and called it “Accounts” the Excel software will add its 
  own four letter extension to your file name. It will add <B>.xlsx</B>. So you 
  file name will be “Accounts.xlsx” and not just “Accounts”. So you get a different 
  four letter extension depending on the software you used.</P>
<P>These extensions are very important to computers. They are used to identify 
  the type of file it is. With a file extension, Word can recognise its own documents. 
  It sees the letters <B>docx</B> and says “Ah yes, that’s one of mine. I can 
  open it.” If it sees a different extension, <B>xlsx</B> for example, it says 
  “What the heck is that?” You may then get an error message telling you that 
  the file type is not recognised.</P>
<P>Web pages have their own file extensions. Oddly there are two different extensions, 
  a three letter file extension and a four letter extension. Web pages come with 
  the extension <B>.htm</B> or <B>.html</B>. A browser can recognise either extension.</P>
<P>When you open up a web page with your browser, Internet Explorer for example, 
  the browser software checks the file extension, the same check that Word and 
  Excel make. If it sees the <B>.htm</B> or <B>.html</B> extension it knows it’s 
  a web page and then tries to open it. (Modern browsers, though, can open up 
  other types of files. Internet Explorer can open up your Word documents and 
  PDF files.)</P>
<P>Behind the scenes, however, the thing that Internet Explorer is trying to open 
  is really a text file that has had its extension changed from <B>.txt</B> to 
  <B>.htm</B>. The text file though will have special symbols and words, called 
  Tags. When the browser sees these Tags it goes to work, displaying whatever 
  you typed and hiding the Tags from your viewers.</P>
<P>Most web pages on the internet are written in code called HTML. HTML stands 
  for HyperText Markup Language, and is fairly easy to get the hang of. That’s 
  because HTML is not a programming language: it is a language designed to improve 
  the presentation of text. For example, in Microsoft Word, if you want a nice 
  big heading, you can select a font size from a menu. HTML has an easy way to 
  change the size of text of headings, too, which you’ll see in a moment. But 
  that’s basically all you are doing with HTML – presenting text and images on 
  a page. The way you do this is with things called TAGS.</P>

<h3>What is HTML 5?</h3>
<P>HTML comes in different versions. When people talk about HTML 5 they are talking 
  about the updates to the mark up language. These updates were agreed (mostly) 
  by a whole host of different parties, all members of an organisation called 
  W3C. W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, who also created the first 
  version of HTML and invented the World Wide Web. They now oversee the defining 
  of new Web technologies. Comapnies who make browser like Microsoft (Internet 
  Explorer), Mozilla (FireFox), and Apple (Safari) can then decide which of the 
  new Web technoligies they wish to implement. </P>
<p>Most of the big names in browser technology decided to implement quite a lot 
  of the new suggested updates (specifications) put forward by the W3C. These 
  specifications are commonly known as HTML 5. In practice, this means implementing 
  features like HTML Video and audio directly into the browser, as opposed to 
  needing a 3rd party plugin like Adobe's Flash. Another exciting update is something 
  called the Canvas tag. This allows you to create quite sophisticated animations 
  and graphics using Javascipt, again without needing a 3rd-party plugin.</p>
<p>There are a whole lot of new HTML tags that takes browser technogoloy forward 
  into the 21st century. Thoughout this course, we'll introducde you to the essential 
  HTML 5 tags that you need in order to create a modern web page.<br>
