</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the <a href="wds4p2.html">previous section</a>, you learnt about relative 
  file referencing. In this section, we'll continue the lesson with some practical 
  work.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Navigate to where on your hard drive you saved your HTML pages. For us, this 
  was a folder called HTML. Inside of the HTML folder, create two more. Call one 
  of the folders <b>images</b> and the other <b>pages</b>. If you're using a Windows 
  computer, your Explorer window will then look like this (Windows 7):</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/explorer_folders.gif" alt="Folder structure for a web site"></P>
<P>Double click your template text file and add the following HTML image code:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/template_html.gif" alt="Text editor showing image HTML code"></P>
<P>Click <b>File &gt; Save As</b> and save your template as a HTML file. But save 
  it in your new pages folder, and call it <b>images.html</b>. Don't forget to 
  change the <b>Save as type</b> box to <b>All Files</b>, if you're using Windows:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/save_page.gif" alt="Windows Explorer showing folder structure"></P>
<P>Once you have saved your template as a HTML web page, double click it to open 
  it up in your browser. You should see this, if you are using Firefox:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/images_firefox.gif" alt="Firefox showing broken image reference"></P>
<P>If you are using Internet Explorer, however, you should see this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/images_ie.gif" alt="Internet Explorer showing broken image reference"></P>
<p>In both cases, the image has not displayed. Firefox displays a broken file 
  icon, and Internet Explorer displays a red X icon. The reason is that the browser 
  can't find the file. So if you see either of those icons in future, just remember 
  that the browser is telling you &quot;Image File Not Found&quot;.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we have some files for you. The file you need is in 
  the <b>extra_files</b> folder that came with this course. (If you haven't got 
  the extra files yet, the download location is here, under the heading <b>Web 
  Design - New Course</b> : <a href="../downloads/downloads.html">Download the 
  Extra Files needed for this course</a> (You don't need the downloads for the 
  old course.)</p>
<p>Double click the <b>extra_files</b> folder, and then double click the <b>york_images 
  </b>folder. Copy the <b>york_minster.jpg </b>file and paste it into your <b>HTML/pages</b> 
  folder. Your pages folder will then look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/explorer_image_webpage.gif" alt="Windows Explorer showing folder structure"></P>
<p>The image and the web page are in the same folder, the <b>pages</b> folder. 
  Notice the file size of the image - 747 kilobytes. Could be a bit big on the 
  internet, and we'd want to look into this.</p>
<p>Once you've copied the image over, refresh your HTML page in your browser. 
  You should see the image appear:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/image_minster.gif" alt="An image showing in a browser"></P>
<p>If you don't see an image, but still have the &quot;Image File Not Found&quot; 
  icon, make sure the SRC part of the HTML is correct:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>SRC=&quot;york_minster.jpg&quot;</b></p>
<p>Note the lowercase spelling, and the two double quote marks. A common error 
  is to spell SRC as SCR. Make sure, too, that the image and the web page are 
  in the same folder.</p>
<p>Once you get the image displayed in the browser, create another folder inside 
  the <b>pages</b> folder. Call this one <b>york_images</b>. Your explorer window 
  should then look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/york_images_folder.gif" alt="Windows Explorer showing folder structure"></P>
<p>Now move the <b>york_minster.jpg</b> image to the <b>york_images</b> folder. 
  Your explorer window will then look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/york_images_folder_2.gif" alt="Windows Explorer showing folder structure"></P>
<p>Reload your web page in your browser. You should see the &quot;Image Not Found&quot; 
  icon again.</p>
<p>Go back to your HTML code and change the IMG line to this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;york_images/york_minster.jpg&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>So we've added the folder name, then a forward slash. This denotes a folder 
  in the same directory as the HTML page. After the forward slash, we have the 
  image name. What we're saying here is, &quot;In the same folder as the <b>images.html</b> 
  page, look for a folder called <b>york_images</b>. In this folder there is an 
  image called <b>york_minster.jpg</b>&quot;.</p>
<p>Save your work and reload the <b>images.html</b> web page in your browser. 
  You should see the image reappear.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"

<h3>Advanced file referencing</h3>
<p>Previously, you created an images folder and a pages folder. This:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/explorer_folders.gif" alt="Folder structure for a web site"></P>
<p>For neatness sake, this is a good idea: you can have most of your html pages 
  in the pages folder, and all your pictures in the <b>images</b> folder. (We 
  say most of your html pages because there is an exception called the <b>index.html</b> 
  page. You'll learn about this a bit later.)</p>
<p>One difficulty about this approach is that file referencing becomes a lot harder. 
  Suppose we moved the <b>york_images</b> folder inside of the <b>images</b> folder. 
  If we did, the code we wrote before would no longer work. This line:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;york_images/york_minster.jpg&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>That's because there would no longer be a folder called <b>york_images</b> 
  in the same location as the <b>images.html</b> file. The image is now one folder 
  up from the <b>pages</b> folder. The code would therefore be this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;../images/york_images/york_minster.jpg&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>After SRC we now have two dots and a forward slash. Two dots and a forward 
  slash mean &quot;go up one folder from where you are&quot;. (Remember, this 
  is all relative to the <b>images.html</b> page, where the code is.) The browser 
  will then look for a folder called <b>images</b>. It will search this folder 
  for one called <b>york_images</b>. Then it will look for the image specified.</p>
<p>Don't worry if all that is not too clear: we'll keep images and image folders 
  together, just for simplicity's sake. But if you're still not sure about file 
  referencing, we've produced a video for you here: <a href="video_file_referencing.html" target="_blank">File 
  Referencing Video</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next lesson, you'll learn about Image Attributes.<br>
