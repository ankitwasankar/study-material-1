<H1 ID="Article">HTML Form Elements - The Form Tags</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>HTML forms are a way of gathering data from visitors to your page. Forms typically 
  have text boxes for data input, radio buttons, drop down boxes, and buttons 
  so that users can submit the form. A reset button is also handy, just in case 
  mistakes are made filling out the form.</P>
<p>For this section, create a new web page in your text editor. Save the file 
  as <b>forms.html</b>. We'll add the different form elements as we go along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Form Tag</h3>
<p>You don't have to tell your browser about any form elements on your web page. 
  If you just want a simple form element like a text box, you can insert the text 
  box tag by itself. But if you want to do something with the information on your 
  form, like send it somewhere or to someone, you have to &quot;tell&quot; your 
  browser about the form elements on your page. You do this with the Form tag:</p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;FORM&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> &lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
<p>Like most HTML tags, the FORM tag comes as a pair, the forward slash preceding 
  the second FORM tag to indicate that the form tag ends. Any form elements you 
  need then go between these two FORM tags.</p>
<p>A NAME attribute is a useful addition to the FORM tag. When the form has a 
  name, you can then refer to it in scripts. </p>
<p class="indent_big">&lt;FORM NAME = &quot;frmTest&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> &lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
<p>To give your form a name, type a space after FORM then type the word NAME, 
  followed by an equals sign. Finally, add a name for your form. You can call 
  it anything you like. Here, we've called the form <b>frmTest</b>. </p>
<p>If you want your form to go somewhere or to someone, two other attributes are 
  needed in the FORM tag: METHOD and ACTION. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;FORM NAME = &quot;frmTest&quot; METHOD = &quot;post&quot; 
  Action =&quot;mailto:me@me.com&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
<p>METHOD is way to send the data. There are two options, Post and Get. Post sends 
  the data in single lines of text; Get squashes all the data in a single line 
  and adds it to the URL in the Action part. If the URL was an internet address, 
  you'd see all the data you're sending in the address bar of your browser. This 
  sort of thing:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">ProcessSurvey.html?text1=John&amp;text2=Smith</p>
<p>The first name John was typed into the text box called &quot;text1&quot; and 
  the surname Smith went into the text box called &quot;text2&quot;. Form elements 
  are separated by an ampersand ( &amp; ). That is a direct result of using the 
  Get method to send data. The Post method doesn't add all that code to the address 
  bar of your browser.</p>
<p>You should use Post to send your data, rather than Get.</p>
<p>ACTION is used to specify the address where you want to send the data. Here, 
  we're using an Email link to send the data straight to an email address:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">ACTION = mailto:me@me.com</p>
<p>But the form can be processed by a scripting language like CGI, ASP .NET, PHP, 
  etc. In which case you'd specify the address of the script in question: </p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">ACTION = &quot;ProcessSurvey.php&quot;</p>
<p>To ensure that data in your forms is not sent anywhere, you can just add a 
  pair of double quotes to the ACTION attribute:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">ACTION = &quot;&quot;</p>
<p>This is good for testing purposes.</p>
<P class="TextAlignment">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3498263538959058";
/* Web_design_Top */
google_ad_slot = "1580651452";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="../../pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</P>
<h3>Form Elements</h3>
<p>There are quite a few different form elements you can add to a form:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">Text Boxes<br>
  Text Areas<br>
  Option Buttons<br>
  Check Boxes<br>
  Drop down List/Fixed Lists<br>
  Password Boxes<br>
  Command Buttons<br>
  Submit Buttons<br>
  Reset Buttons<br>
  Labels<br>
  Image Command Buttons<br>
  Hidden Form Values</p>
<p>HTML5, however, adds even more. There's even a very handy attribute called 
  placeholder:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">Placeholder<br>
  Email<br>
  Url<br>
  Number<br>
  Range<br>
  Date/Time<br>
  Search<br>
  Color</p>
<p>Some of these new form elements are only supported in certain browsers, however. 
  For example, Color refers to a popup colour picker. Only the Opera web browser 
  supports this, at the time of writing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few sections, we'll take a closer look at all the form elements 
  above. </p>
