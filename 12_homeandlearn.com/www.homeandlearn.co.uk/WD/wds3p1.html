</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>HTML was not intended to be a graphic design tool. It was set up as a simple 
  way to display text in a browser, rather like a word processor displays text 
  on a page. Tags were added over the years in order to add a bit of colour and 
  life into the basic white page (actually, grey at first). So along came things 
  like images, tables, frames, and forms. These could all be presented on the 
  page using straight HTML code.</P>
<P>Web designers clamoured for a better way to present their work on a web page. 
  Plain HTML just wasn’t enough. After all, with HTML, in order to get text or 
  an image exactly where you want it, you have to resort to complicated tables 
  to force the alignment. And suppose you want colour behind a single paragraph 
  of text, and not have to colour the entire page? Very tricky with straight HTML. 
  And what about hyperlinks? Is there any way, with HTML, that we can turn the 
  underline on and off?</P>
<P>These questions, and many more, were finally addressed by the introduction 
  of Cascading Stylesheets. A Style is, basically, just another way to manipulate 
  elements on a page, in order to bring a spark of life into your web design.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>What is a Stylesheet?</H3>
<P>If you were using a word processor like Microsoft Word, you could tell the 
  word processor how you want blocks of text to be formatted. For example, all 
  of your page Headings could be in 28 point Times, bold, and coloured red. If 
  you wanted the same Heading again, you can just click a drop down list and select 
  the Heading style you set up.</P>
<P>Using straight HTML, you can’t do that. There’s no way to apply the same formatting 
  with a single Tag. Cascading Stylesheets, however, let you do precisely that 
  – change whole blocks of text with a single tag. This not only makes your code 
  easier to read, it is also very simple to change all the formatted blocks of 
  text to say a different font size or font colour.</P>
<P>For example, in HTML, if you want to set the first paragraph of every page 
  to bold and italics, you’d have to do this for every single paragraph that needs 
  it:</P>
<DIV class ="LeftRightMargins"> &lt;P&gt;<BR>
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first paragraph on page One. The same font styles 
  are needed for each page on my web site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/B&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/P&gt; </DIV>
<P>With Stylesheets, you can get rid of all that code, and place it in the HEAD 
  section of your page. You would then just apply the Style to any paragraph that 
  needs it. Like this:</P>
<DIV class ="LeftRightMargins"> &lt;P Class = "FirstParagraph"&gt;<BR>
  This is the first paragraph on page one. The same font styles are needed for 
  each page on my web site.<BR>
  &lt;/P&gt; </DIV>
<P>The new code, I’m sure you’ll agree, looks much cleaner. And if you decided 
  that the text colour should be blue, you can just make one change to your Stylesheet 
  code and all the first paragraphs of your pages would change.</P>
<P>A stylesheet is set up by using the word STYLE in between two angle brackets. 
  An end STYLE tag is needed to tell the browser to stop formatting the style:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;STYLE&gt;</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;/STYLE&gt;</P>
<P>Your stylesheet code then goes between the two Style tags. Here’s a style that 
  can change text blue:</P>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;STYLE&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> .Font1 { Color: Blue }</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/STYLE&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;P Class =&quot; Font1&quot;&gt;</p>
<p class="indent_big"> This is my text.</p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/P&gt;</p>
<P>Although you may not understand the code layout yet, the point is that you 
  can add other styles to the one above that we have called Font1. We can add 
  a bold style and a size style:</P>
<P class="indent_small">&lt;STYLE&gt;</P>
<p> <span class="indent_big">.Font1 {</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">Color: Blue;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">Font-size: 24pt;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">Font-weight: Bold;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_big">}</span> </p>
<p class="indent_small">&lt;/STYLE&gt;</p>
<P>Now the part of the code where we applied the style (P Class = Font1) will 
  have its text updated. We don’t have to make any changes at all to the P part 
  of the code.</P>
<P>So a style is way to change blocks of code (or even individual words) and apply 
  formatting to the block as a whole. You don’t need individual HTML tags in the 
  BODY of your page; just using the style name once will ensure that your formatting 
  is applied to the whole block.</P>
