<P>You remember at <a href="wds1p3-2.html">the start of this course</a> we talked 
  about file extensions, and you learnt what the <b>.html</b> file extension was? 
  You're now going to learn about two new file extensions: JPEG and GIF.</P>
<p>Just like web pages and word process documents have file extensions, so too 
  do images have file extensions. There are a wide range of file extensions used 
  for images. The two most popular file extensions used on web pages are JPEG 
  and GIF. (PNG is another popular image format. It's similar to GIF, so we won't 
  discuss it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>GIF Images</h3>
<p>GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format, and was developed by Compuserve. 
  It uses something called a LZW compression algorithm to reduce the size of the 
  file. The size of your images on web pages is a crucial factor for people using 
  slower connections. If you have an image that is 1 megabyte in size, and I only 
  have a 2 megabit connection speed then it's going to take about 4 seconds to 
  load the image on the page. That may not seem a long time, but if my speed drops 
  to 500 kilobits per second then it will take 16 seconds to appear. I'm not likely 
  to wait that long for your image to load!</p>
<p>So compressing the size of an image makes sense on the internet. If you've 
  taken a photo and then saved it to your computer, take note of the file extension 
  used. The software package you use to view the image will probably give you 
  the opportunity to save the file in another format. Saving the file as a GIF 
  image will greatly reduce the size of the file.</p>
<p>There is a down side, however, in converting to a GIF. The number of colours 
  in your image is capped at 256 colours. For realistic photos, this is not nearly 
  enough. And although your file size is greatly reduced so too could be the quality 
  of your image.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>JPEG</h3>
<p>JPEG is the other popular image format used on web pages. It stands for Joint 
  Photographic Experts Group, and allows you to have images with more than 256 
  colours. In fact, millions more. Again, your original image is compressed when 
  you convert to a JPEG image, so some loss of quality is inevitable. If you want 
  to show off your photos in their best light, converting to JPEG rather than 
  GIF is the best option for the internet. The size of the file might be slightly 
  higher, but then so will the quality.</p>
<p>The downside to JPEG images is that jpeg is a Loss Compression format. This 
  means that image quality goes down (rapidly) the more times you compress and 
  uncompress the image. This happens when you save the file over and over again. 
  GIF on the other hand is a Lossless Compression format, meaning there will be 
  no loss of quality when you compress and uncompress the image.</p>
<p>Another thing you can't do with JPEG images is have a transparent background. 
  So if your image was this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter3/black-background-2.gif" alt="Example of an image on a black background"></P>
<p>and you wanted to get rid of that black background, you could set the black 
  colour as a transparent colour, if you save as a GIF. With a JPEG, you're stuck 
  with the black background. (You can also animate GIF images, which you can't 
  do with JPEG images.)</p>
<p>In general, if your image is less than 256 colours, then save the image as 
  a GIF; if the image is more than 256 colours, and quality is important, then 
  save the image as a JPEG. (Modern digital cameras and mobile phones usually 
  save your pictures in the JPEG format.)</p>
