</HEADER> <SECTION> The websites of Web Hosting companies can be a minefield of 
jargon. Here are some of the things to look out for.

<p><b>Disk Space</b><br>
  This is how much space you get on the hosting company's server. Obviously, the 
  more the merrier, here. But it's highly unlikely that you'll need a Gigabyte 
  of disk space, unless your web site contains lots of large images or videos. 
  But the average site won't even be 50 megabyte in size never mind 500 megabytes. 
  So don't just base your decision on Disk Space.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Data Transfer</b><br>
  This refers to how much download activity occurs on your site each month. (Data 
  Transfer is also known as Bandwidth.) Say, for example, that each page on your 
  site is 10 kilobytes in size (pretty small, these days). If 1000 visitors come 
  to your site each day they will be downloading 10, 000 kilobytes of data, or 
  10 megabytes. Multiply that by the number of days in a month and the data transfer 
  will be about 300 megabytes a month. If the Web Hosting company you sign up 
  for only allows 100 megabytes of traffic each month then they will cut you off 
  when that limit is reached. Your site will then be down until next month.</p>
<p>It's a pretty rare Web Hosting company that does this, though. And a 100 megabytes 
  data transfer limit is fairly puny. What you'll normally see here is the dreaded 
  word &quot;unlimited&quot;. A lot of hosts put an asterisk next to &quot;unlimited&quot; 
  which leads to a fair use policy. Which, of course, means it's not really unlimited. 
  Your site would really need to take off, though, for the fair use policy to 
  kick in. But pay attention to when this is.</p>
<P><b>Resellers</b><br>
  Not every hosting company has their own servers. Some will rent server space 
  from another company. They will then resell some server space to you. So when 
  you sign up for a reseller just remember that they don't own their own servers. 
  If something goes wrong they will have to get in touch with the parent company 
  and find out what's going on, and how long it will take to fix the problem. 
  In the meantime, your site will be down. There's not much the reseller can do 
  about it, though, other than to nag their parent company.</P>
<p>Most resellers are decent small businesses, who will go out of their way to 
  help you. In fact, one of the advantages of a reseller is that personal touch 
  you just don't get with &quot;big boys&quot; of the web hosting business.</p>
<p>So don't be afraid of signing up with a reseller, especially the ones that 
  are up-front about it. But be wary of those resellers who hide the fact in the 
  small print, and whose contact details are minimal or absent. A good trick is 
  to try to phone up your prospective hosting company just to find out how fast 
  they answer. If they only do email support don't be put off, as telephone support 
  is quite expensive. But do check to see how fast you get a response to a sign-up 
  query.</p>
<p><b>Linux, Windows, Apache, IIS</b><br>
  The server software that a hosting company runs is usually Apache. This will 
  be running on a Linux operating system. IIS stands for Internet Information 
  Services and is server software by Microsoft running on Windows. If you want 
  an ASP NET web site then you'll need to go with IIS/Windows. However, most hosting 
  companies will offer the cheaper Linux/Apache solution rather than IIS/Windows. 
  (You can run PHP scripts on both Windows and Linux servers.)</p>
<p>If you don't really care about any of this then go for the Linux/Apache solution.</p>
<p><b>mySQL database</b><br>
  If you need to store information in a database then on Linux hosting this is 
  called mySQL, which is a database owned by Sun, just like the Access database 
  is owned by Microsoft. You'll normally only get 1 mySQL database. Hosting companies 
  that have their own servers, however, usually offer you more.</p>
<p><b>Email</b><br>
  It's very handy to be able to send and receive email with your own domain name. 
  For our example domain name, it would be handy of we could contact our customers 
  using orders@blackwidgets.com rather than, say, orders@gmail.com. Most Hosting 
  companies offer POP3 or IMAP email. These are ways to receive email. If you 
  want to be able to send email with your domain name then look out for SMTP. 
  This would mean that the emails will be going through their servers, rather 
  than your ISP's servers. What this means is that if you are not reliant on your 
  Internet Service Provider to forward emails, if indeed they would let you.</p>
<p>If being able to send as well as receive emails with your domain name is important 
  then don't forget to ask about both. Resellers tend to let you receive but not 
  send, so POP3 but not SMTP.</p>
<p><b>Templates</b><br>
  If you haven't got the time to create a web site, then some Web Hosting companies 
  let you use their in-built templates to create a site. This will be via a simple 
  wizard system. Other templates to look out for are WordPress, if you're going 
  to be blogging, and Joomla, if you need a Content Management System.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>cPanel login</b><br>
  cPanel is a piece of server software that handles the administration side of 
  things, such as setting up email accounts, managing databases, checking diskspace, 
  and a whole lot more besides. If you sign up for a reseller you'll more than 
  likely have a cPanel login.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SSL</b><br>
  SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. It's a way to encrypt connections between 
  a server and a client. If you need files to be securely transferred and not 
  just available to everyone then look out for a SSL option. You may also need 
  SSL if you have an area on your site where people need to log in. You can tell 
  if SSL is being used because the address in the address bar of your browser 
  will say https://www.blackwidgets.com and not just http://www.blackwidgets.com 
  (the difference is the &quot;s&quot; after &quot;http&quot;). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FTP</b><br>
  FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. This is used to transfer the files and 
  web pages from your computer to your web space. You can get FTP software that 
  simplifies the job. You enter the details provided by your web hosting company 
  and then connect. After that it will be a matter of dragging and dropping files 
  from your computer to theirs. Here's an example of setting up your FTP software:<br>
</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter10/ftp_setup.gif" alt="An FTP dialogue box"></P>
<P>For the Host/IP/URL section this is usually your domain name with FTP in front 
  of it. But your Web Hosting company will send you an email with these details. 
  When you click Connect the software will attempt to log in using your username 
  and password. If you're successful, you'll see folders like these for Linux 
  hosting:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter10/folders_linux.gif" alt="Web hosting folder structure"></P>
<P>Double-click the <b>public_html</b> folder and uploaded all your web pages 
  into there. Windows hosting will be very similar but may just say <b>public</b> 
  instead of <b>public_html</b>.</P>

<h3>Some Web Hosts</h3>
<p>If you're in the UK then the big players in Web Hosting business are www.123-reg.co.uk 
  and www.fasthosts.co.uk. 123-reg is owned by Webfusion, which has its own hosting 
  here: www.webfusion.co.uk/web-hosting/.</p>
<p>All three of these sites are worth a visit. Look out for all the items we've 
  discussed above, and make note of what other extras they offer. Most of these 
  extras you won't need, so don't be bamboozled by them!</p>
<p>Another Web Hosting company to consider is Netweaver (www.netweaver.co.uk). 
  Although they don't offer as many frills as the big players, they are very reliable. 
  They have their own servers, too.<br>
