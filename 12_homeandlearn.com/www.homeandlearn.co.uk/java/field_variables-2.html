<p>In a previous section, we talked about variables inside of methods. The variables 
  you set up inside of methods are only available to those methods. They are not 
  available to other methods. They are said to have local scope.</p>
<p>However, you can set up variables outside of methods that all the methods in 
  your class can see. These are known as Field variables (or Instance variables). 
  You set them up in exactly the same way as any other variable. Add the following 
  four fields to <a href="write_your_own_java_classes-2.html">your new StudentResults 
  class</a>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_fields-2.gif" width="259" height="187" border="1" alt="Global field variables"> 
</p>
<p>We're setting up four string variables (four string fields). As the names of 
  the fields suggest, the string will hold a person's name, an exam name, a score, 
  and a grade. These four fields will be available to all the methods that we 
  write in this class, and won't be local to any one method. They are said to 
  have global scope.</p>
<p>To see just how global they are, click back on to your ExamDetails class, the 
  one with the main method. Add the following line of code to create a new object 
  from your StudentResults class:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_new_object-2.gif" width="457" height="202" border="1" alt="Create a new object from the StudentResults class"></p>
<p>This is the same as we did in the previous section - used the new keyword to 
  create a new object. The name of the object will be <b>aStudent</b>, and it 
  is of type StudentResults, which is our class.</p>
<p>On the next line, type the name of the variable (aStudent), followed by a dot. 
  As soon as you type the dot NetBeans display a popup list of methods and properties 
  available to your object:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_fields-2.gif" width="420" height="337" border="1" alt="List showing available field variables"></p>
<p>The four fields that we set up are on the list. They are not methods, but something 
  called a property. The fact that they are on the list at all means that they 
  have global scope. If they had local scope they wouldn't be on the list. </p>
<p>You can set values for properties. Try this: add the following highlighted 
  code to your main method:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_fields2-2.gif" width="451" height="242" border="1" alt="Accsessing a property"></p>
<p>We've selected the <b>Exam_Name</b> field from the list and assigned it the 
  value &quot;VB NET&quot;. The next line then gets the value of Exam_Name from 
  the aStudent object. The result is stored in a variable called exam, and then 
  printed out. When you run the programme, the output is the string &quot;VB Net&quot;.</p>
<p>So the four variables we've set up are now available to both classes.</p>
<p>However, it's not a good idea to make field variables global like this. You 
  tend to lose track of just what values are being held in them, and it therefore 
  makes debugging your code a lot harder. It's considered good coding to narrow 
  the scope of field variables.</p>
<p>To make a field variable available only to a particular class, you add the 
  Java keyword <b>private</b> just before the field declaration. Change the code 
  in your StudentResults class to this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_fields_private-2.gif" width="281" height="184" border="1" alt="Making the filed variables private"></p>
<p>Now, only code within the StudentResults class can see these field variables. 
  To check, go back to your main method. You should see some warnings and red 
  underlines:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_fields_warnings-2.gif" width="492" height="176" border="1" alt="Properties are now local in scope"></p>
<p>Delete the three lines at the bottom. Type <b>aStudent</b> and then a dot again 
  to see the NetBeans popup list:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_fields3-2.gif" width="359" height="197" border="1" alt="Field variables are no longer on the NetBeans list"></p>
<p>As you can see, the four field variables have now vanished. They have vanished 
  because they no longer have global scope, and therefore can't be seen from the 
  ExamDetails class.</p>
<p>In the next part, you'll learn about something called a <b>class constructor</b>.</p>
