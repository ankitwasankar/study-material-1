<H1 ID="Article">How to Create Variables in VB .NET</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>Why are we discussing variables? And what is a variable? </P>
<p>With Visual Basic, and most programming languages, what you are doing is storing 
  things in the computer's memory, and manipulating this store. If you want to 
  add two numbers together, you put the numbers into storage areas and &quot;tell&quot; 
  Visual Basic to add them up. But you can't do this without variables.</p>
<p>So a variable is a storage area of the computer's memory. Think of it like 
  this: a variable is an empty cardboard box. Now, imagine you have a very large 
  room, and in this room you have a whole lot of empty cardboard boxes. Each empty 
  cardboard box is a single variable. To add two numbers together, write the first 
  number on a piece of paper and put the piece of paper into an empty box. Write 
  the second number on a piece of paper and put this second piece of paper in 
  a different cardboard box.</p>
<p>Now, out of all your thousands of empty cardboard boxes two of them contain 
  pieces of paper with numbers on them. To help you remember which of the thousands 
  of boxes hold your numbers, put a sticky label on each of the two boxes. Write 
  &quot;number1&quot; on the first sticky label, and &quot;number2&quot; on the 
  second label.</p>
<p>What have we just done? Well, we've created a large memory area (the room and 
  the cardboard boxes), and we've set up two of the boxes to hold our numbers 
  (two variables). We've also given each of these variables a name (the sticky 
  labels) so that we can remember where they are.</p>
<p>Now examine this:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim number1 As Integer<br>
  Dim number2 As Integer</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">number1 = 3<br>
  number2 = 5</p>
<p>That's code from Visual Basic Net. It's VB's way of setting up (or declaring) 
  variables.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the variable Declaration:<br>
</p>
<dl> 
  <dt class="dt_red">Dim</dt>
  <dd> Short for Dimension. It's a type of variable. You declare (or &quot;tell&quot; 
    Visual Basic) that you are setting up a variable with this word. We'll meet 
    other types of variables later, but for now just remember to start your variable 
    declarations with Dim.</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">number1</dt>
  <dd>This is the cardboard box and the sticky label all in one. This is a variable. 
    In other words, our storage area. After the Dim word, Visual Basic is looking 
    for the name of your variable. You can call your variable almost anything 
    you like, but there are a few reserved words that VB won't allow. It's good 
    practice to give your variables a name appropriate to what is going in the 
    variable.</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">As Integer</dt>
  <dd>We're telling Visual Basic that the variable is going to be a number (integer). 
    Well meet alternatives to Integer later.</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">Number1 = 3</dt>
  <dd>The equals sign is not actually an equals sign. The = sign means assign 
    a value of. In other words, here is where you put something in your variable. 
    We're telling Visual Basic to assign a value of 3 to the variable called number1. 
    Think back to the piece of paper going into the cardboard box. Well, this 
    is the programming equivalent of writing a value on a piece of paper</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that you have a basic idea of what variables are, let's write a little 
  piece of code to test them out. First, though, let's have our first look at 
  the coding window. </p>
<p>To make life easier, we're going to put a button on our form. When our button 
  is clicked, a little message box will pop up. Fortunately, there's no coding 
  to write for a button, and very little at all for a message box. </p>
