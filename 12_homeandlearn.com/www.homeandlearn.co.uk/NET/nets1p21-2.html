</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<p>The Select Case statement is another way to test what is inside of a variable. 
  You can use it when you know there is only a limited number of things that could 
  be in the variable. For example, suppose we add another choice for that cream 
  cake. We've only said that the consequences of eating the cream cake is that 
  the Diet will be either &quot;Ruined&quot; or &quot;Not Ruined&quot;. But what 
  if we add another option - &quot;Diet Not Tested&quot;. In other words, we ate 
  the cake but refused to climb onto the scales to weigh ourselves!</p>
<p>With three choices, we can still use an If ... Else statement. But let's change 
  it to a Select Case statement. Remember: all we are doing is testing what is 
  inside a variable, in this case a variable called <b>creamcake</b>. Once we 
  decide what is inside the variable, we can take some action. So let's look at 
  how the Select Case works.</p>
<p>Create a Form with a button and a Textbox on it (If you have your form open 
  from the <a href="nets1p20-2.html">previous section</a>, then you can use this 
  one). Double click the new button. You should see something like this appear.</p>
<p class="indent_small">Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, 
  _<br>
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _<br>
  Handles Button1.Click</p>
<p class="indent_small">End Sub</p>
<p>Between the button Sub and End Sub code add the folowing</p>
<P class="indent_small">Dim creamcake As String<br>
  Dim DietState As String</P>
<p class="indent_small">creamcake = TextBox1.Text</p>
<p class="indent_small">Select Case creamcake</p>
<p> <span class="indent_big">Case &quot;Eaten&quot;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">DietState = &quot;Diet Ruined&quot;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_big">Case &quot;Not Eaten&quot;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">DietState = &quot;Diet Not Ruined&quot;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_big">Case Else</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">DietState = &quot;Didn't check&quot;</span><br>
</P>
<P class="indent_small">End Select</p>
<p class="indent_small">MsgBox DietState</p>
<p>Run your code to test it out. Click inside your textbox and enter the word 
  &quot;Eaten&quot;. Then click your button to see what happens. Now enter the 
  words &quot;Not Eaten&quot; and click your button. Next, try the word &quot;eaten&quot;, 
  with a lowercase &quot;e&quot;.</p>
<p>So, how does the Select case work?</p>
<p>In the code above, we first set up two variables called <B>creamcake</B> and 
  DietState. Next, we transfer whatever is in <B>Textbox1</B> to the variable 
  <B>creamcake</B>. The Select Case begins on the next line:</p>
<p class="indent_small">Select Case creamcake</p>
<p>We tell Visual Basic that we want to start a Select Case statement by simply 
  using the words &quot;Select Case&quot;. This is enough to set up the statement. 
  The variable <b>creamcake</b> follows the words Select Case. We're saying, &quot;Set 
  up a Select Case statement to test what is inside the variable called creamcake&quot;. 
  The next line is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">Case &quot;Eaten&quot;</p>
<p>We ask Visual Basic to check if the variable creamcake contains the word &quot;Eaten&quot;. 
  (Is it the Case that ... ?)</p>
<p><b>If it is the Case that</b> creamcake contains the word &quot;Eaten&quot;, 
  then VB will drop down to the line or lines of code below and read that. If 
  the variable creamcake doesn't contain the word &quot;Eaten&quot;, the programme 
  will skip the line or lines of code below and jump to the next Case. </p>
<p>The programme will continue to check all the words after Case to see if one 
  of them contains what is in the variable creamcake. If it finds one, it will 
  read the code below the Case word; if it doesn't find any matches, it will not 
  do anything at all. In our code, we're checking these three Cases:</p>
<P class="indent_small_no_bold"><b>Case</b> &quot;Eaten&quot;<br>
  <b>Case</b>&quot;Not Eaten&quot;<br>
  <b>Case</b> Else</P>
Note also that it will only look for an exact match - &quot;Eaten&quot;, but not 
&quot;eaten&quot;. 
<p>The next line to examine is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">Case Else</p>
<p>You can use the <b>Else</b> word after Case. If the programme hasn't found 
  any matches, it will then execute the code below the Case Else line.</p>
<p>The final line to examing is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">End Select</p>
<p>All we're doing here is to tell Visual basic to end the Select Case statement.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="links_ads"><a href="../bookshop/net-2.html">No more reading 
  these lessons online - get the eBook here!</a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the Select Case checks a variable for any number of different choices. If 
  a match is found, it will then execute code below the Case option it has found. 
  In our code, we've just told the programme to store some text in the DietState 
  variable. After the Select Case statement has ended we displayed the variable 
  in a Message Box.</p>
<p>You can use Select Case statement with numbers, as well, and the <b>To</b> 
  word comes in very handy here. If you were checking a variable to see if the 
  number that was in the variable fell within a certain age-range, you could use 
  something like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">Select Case agerange
<P> <span class="indent_big">Case 16<b> To</b> 21</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">MsgBox &#147;Still Young&#148;</span><br>
  <span class="indent_big">Case 50 <b>To</b> 64</span><br>
  <span class="indent_bigger">MsgBox &#147;Start Lying&#148;</span> 
<P class="indent_small">End Select</p>
<p>Here, a variable called <font color="#FF0000">agerange</font> is being tested. 
  It's being checked to see if it falls between certain values. If it does, then 
  a message box is displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exercise G</h3>
<p>Add a new button to your form. Write a programme that tests if a person is 
  a) A teenager, b) in their twenties, c) in their thirties, or d) none of the 
  above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A popular way to use Select Case statements is with a drop down box. You can 
  then test which item a user selected from a list of available items. You're 
  going to write a little programme to do just this. But before you can do so, 
  you'll need to know how to add a Combo Box to a form, and how to get at the 
  values in its list. We'll do that in the next section.</p>
