<H1 ID="Article">Adding a Button to a Form</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<p>Instead of double clicking the Button tool in the toolbox to add the control 
  to the form, we'll explore another way to do it.</p>
<p>With your Form displayed in the Visual Basic Design environment, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the Button tool in the toolbox with the left hand mouse button, 
    but click only once</li>
  <li>Move your mouse to a blank area of your form - the mouse pointer will turn 
    into a cross</li>
  <li>Press and hold down the left mouse button</li>
  <li>Drag across the form with the button held down</li>
  <li>Let go of the mouse button when you're happy with the size</li>
  <li>A Button is drawn</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the above method to draw most of the controls onto the form - labels, 
  Buttons, textboxes, etc. </p>
<p>The Button control, just like all the other controls we've seen so far, has 
  a list of properties. One of these properties is the Text property. At the moment, 
  your button will say &quot;Button 1&quot;. You can change that to anything you 
  like.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the Button to highlight it</li>
  <li>Click on Text in the Property Box</li>
  <li>Click in the box next to the word &quot;Text&quot;</li>
  <li>Delete the word &quot;Button 1&quot;</li>
  <li>Type &quot;Add two numbers&quot;</li>
  <li>Click back on the Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Now add a Textbox to your form using one of the methods outlined (either double-click, 
  or draw).</p>
<p>Your Form should now look something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/VariablesForm-2.gif"></p>
<P>The Font property of the Button has also been changed, here, in exactly the 
  same way as we changed the Font property of the Label and Textbox previously. 
  The Text for the Textbox control has had its default Text (Textbox 1) deleted.</p>
<p>To get our first look at the code window, double click your Button control. 
  The code window will appear, and will look like this in version 2010:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ButtonCode-2.gif" alt="VB NET code stub for a Button" border="1"></p>
<p>And this in version 2012:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2012/chapter2/button_code-2.gif" alt="Button code, VB NET 2012"></p>
<p>In the 2010 version, notice that we've used the underscore character ( _ ) 
  to spread the code over more than one line. You can do this in your own code, 
  if it becomes too long. But you don't have to.</p>
<p>In the 2012 version, notice that the word <b>ByVal</b> is missing between the 
  round brackets. Don't worry about what this means, but we'll cover it much later. 
  (It's still ByVal, in case you're curious, but it's missing because ByVal the 
  default type.)</p>

  these lessons online - get the eBook here!</a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The part to concentrate on for the moment is where your cursor is flashing 
  on and off. Because you double-clicked the Button control, the cursor will be 
  flashing between the lines <b>Private Sub</b> &#133; and <b>End Sub</b>.</p>
<p>Here's the part we're concentrating on:</p>
<p class="indent_big"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Private Sub Button1_Click</b><font color="#000000">(ByVal 
  sender As System.Object, _<br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">Handles Button1.Click</span></font></font></p>
<p class="indent_big"><font color="#FF0000"><b>End Sub</b></font></p>
<p>The part of the code we're interested in is highlighted in red in the code 
  above. Notice, too, that the underscore character ( _ ) has been used to spread 
  the code over more than one line. You can do this in your own code, too, if 
  it becomes to long:</p>
<dl> 
  <dt class="dt_red">Private</dt>
  <dd>Private means that no other part of the programme can see this code except 
    for our button</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">Sub</dt>
  <dd>Short for Subroutine. The "Sub" word tells VB that some code follows, and 
    that it needs to be executed</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">Button1</dt>
  <dd>This is the name of our button. You might think that we've just erased the 
    word "Button1" when we changed the Text property, so why does VB insist that 
    it's still called Button1? We'll, the Name property of the control is the 
    important one. If you change the Name property, VB will change this button 
    name for you</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">_Click ( )</dt>
  <dd>This is something called an Event. In other words, when the button is clicked, 
    the Click Event will fire, and the code we're going to write will be executed</dd>
  <dt class="dt_red">End Sub</dt>
  <dd>The subroutine ends right here. This signifies the end of our code</dd>
</dl>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry if you don't understand all of that. It will become clearer later. 
  Let's add our code, which we'll do on the next page.</p>
