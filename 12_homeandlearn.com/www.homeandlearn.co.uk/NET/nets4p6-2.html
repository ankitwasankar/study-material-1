</p>
<p>For the <a href="nets4p5-2.html">last project</a>, you designed a form interface 
  that had a File, Edit and a View menu. In this section, we'll write code so 
  that your menu items actually do something other than displaying message boxes. 
  In other words, the <b>Edit &gt; Cut</b> menu will really cut text, and the 
  <b>Edit &gt; Paste</b> menu will really paste text.</p>
<p>So open up the project you completed for the <a href="nets4p5-2.html">previous 
  section</a>. Comment out or delete any message box code. (You comment out code 
  by typing a single quote character at the start of the line. The line will then 
  turn green, and will be ignored when the programme is run.)</p>
<p>We'll start with the <b>File &gt; Open</b> menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Open File Dialogue Box</h3>
<p>In most programmes, if you click the <b>File</b> menu, and select the <b>Open</b> 
  item, a dialogue box is displayed. From the dialogue box, you can click on a 
  file to select it, then click the <b>Open</b> button. The file you clicked on 
  is then opened up. We'll see how to do that from our menu. (Except, the file 
  won't open yet - only the dialogue box will display, and then name of the chosen 
  file. You'll learn how to open files in a later section.)</p>
<p>First, place two textboxes on your form. In the properties box, locate the 
  MultiLine property. It is set to False by default (which is why you can't change 
  the height of textboxes). Change this value to <b>True</b>.</p>
<p>Type some default text for the Text Property of textbox1. Change the Font size 
  to 14 points. </p>
<p>Your form should now look something like this one:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/MenuCodeAdd-2.gif" alt="What your form should look like now"></p>
<p align="left">We'll work with these textboxes when we do the <b>Edit</b> menu. 
  So let's leave them for now.</p>
<p>When we click on <b>File &gt; Open</b> from our menu, we want the Open dialogue 
  box to appear. This is fairly straightforward in VB.NET. In fact there is even 
  a control for it!</p>
<p>Open up your toolbox, and locate the control called &quot;<b>OpenFileDialog</b>&quot;. 
  You might have to scroll down to see it. But you're looking for this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/OpenFileControl-2.gif" alt="The Open File Dialog Control" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">Double click the control to add one to your project.</p>
<p>But notice that the control doesn't get added to your form. It gets added to 
  the area at the bottom, next to your menu control:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/OpenFileControl2-2.gif" alt="The Object area in VB .NET" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">The shaded area surrounding the control means that it is selected. 
  If you look on your right, you'll see the properties that you can use with the 
  control.</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Name</b> property and change the name to openFD. When you change 
  the name in the properties box, the name of the control at the bottom will change:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/openFD-2.gif" alt="The Control has been renamed to openFD" border="1"> 
</p>
<p align="left">We&#146;ll now write some code to manipulate the properties of 
  our new control. So do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Access the code for your File &gt; Open menu item. (To do this quickly, 
    you can simply double click the Open item on your menu bar. Or press F7 (CTRL 
    + ALT + 0 in version 2012) to access the Code View.) </li>
  <li> Click the name of your menu item from the left drop down box at the top 
    of the code </li>
  <li> Then select the Click event from the drop down box to the right </li>
  <li> Your empty code should be this (the code below has underscore characters 
    added, so that it can fit on this page): </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Private Sub mnuOpen_Click(ByVal sender As Object, 
  _<br>
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _<br>
  Handles mnuOpen.Click</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Sub</p>
<p><br>
  With you cursor flashing between the two lines of your code, add the following:</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">openFD.ShowDialog()</p>
<p>When you typed a full stop after the <b>openFD</b>, you probably saw a list 
  box appear. You can just double click the <b>ShowDialog()</b> item to add it 
  to your code. </p>
<p>But this method of the OpenFileDialog control does what you'd expect it to 
  do: Shows the dialogue box. You can even test it out right now. Press <b>F5</b> 
  to run your programme. Then click the <b>Open</b> item on your File menu. You 
  should see an <b>Open</b> dialogue box display. </p>
<p>Return to the design environment, and we'll explore some more things you can 
  do with this Dialogue box control.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
<h3>The Initial Directory</h3>
<p>You can set which directory the dialogue box should display when it appears. 
  Instead of it displaying the contents of the &quot;My Documents&quot; folder, 
  for example, you can have it display the contents of any folder. This done with 
  the Initial Directory property. Amend your code to this:</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">openFD.InitialDirectory = &quot;C:\&quot;<br>
  openFD.ShowDialog()</p>
<p>Run your programme again, and see the results in action. You should see the 
  contents of the &quot;C&quot; folder on your hard drive (if you root folder 
  is called something else, change the code above).<br>
</p>
<h3>The Title Property</h3>
<p>By default, the dialogue box will display the word &quot;Open&quot; as a caption 
  at the top of your dialogue box. You can change this with the Title property. 
  Add the line in Bold to your code:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">openFD.InitialDirectory = &quot;C:\&quot;<br>
  openFD.Title = &quot;Open a Text File&quot;<br>
  openFD.ShowDialog()</p>
<p>Run your code again, and Click <b>File &gt; Open</b> from your menu. You should 
  see this at the top of the Open dialogue box:</p>

<p align="left">In the next parts of this tutorial, we'll see how to change the 
  Filter property, and how you can select a file from the list.</p>
