<p><i>If you haven't yet read the introduction to Classes, here it is: <a href="nets11p1.html" target="_blank">VB 
  .NET Classes and Objects</a>.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big benefit of an Object Oriented Programming language is that you can 
  create your own Objects. (It's an Object when you're using the code, remember, 
  and a Class when you're not.)</p>
<p>We'll see how to do that now, as we create a very simple Class, and then turn 
  that into an Object.</p>
<p>The Class we'll create is a very simple one, and is intended to show you the 
  basic technique of setting up a Class, then creating an object from it. The 
  Class we'll create will convert the letters in a postcode to uppercase. We'll 
  get the postcode from a textbox on a form. Off we go then.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start a new VB .NET project</li>
  <li>Add a Textbox to your form, and leave it on the default <b>Name</b>, TextBox1</li>
  <li>Change the <b>Text</b> Property to <b>ts1 4jh </b>(make sure the letters 
    are lowercase and not upper, because our object will convert it.)</li>
  <li>Add a <b>Button</b> to your form</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a new form with a Textbox and a Button on it, you need to add 
  a Class. This is quite easy. It's just like <a href="nets9p7.html">adding a 
  Module</a>. In fact, they look exactly the same!</p>
<ul>
  <li>So from the VB menu bar, click on <b>Project</b></li>
  <li>From the drop down menu, click <b>Add Class</b></li>
  <li>You'll get this dialogue box popping up in version 2008: </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="images/AddClass.gif" alt="The Add New Item dialogue box"></p>
<P>In version 2010, the dialogue box looks like this (version 2012 will be a less 
  colourful version of the one below):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2010/AddNewItem_class.gif" alt="Add New Item - Class"></p>
<P>The Class Template on the right will already be selected. The thing you need 
  to change is the <b>Name</b> at the bottom. The default Name is Class1.vb. This 
  is not terribly descriptive, and you'll have great problems working out what 
  this class does, a few months down the line.</p>
<p>Change the <b>Name</b> from Class1.vb to <b>ConvertPostcode.vb</b>. Then click 
  the <b>Open</b> button.</p>
<p>When the code window for the class opens up, it will look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/AddClassCode.gif" alt="The Class code window" border="1"></p>
<P>As you can see, there's not a great deal to look at! All we have is the <font color="#0000FF">Public 
  Class &#133; End Class</font> code stub. The name of our Class is also there. 
  But the code is in a separate window, and has a tab all to itself. It's this 
  tab full of code that you reuse and turn into an object.</p>
<P>What we have to do now is add the code that does the work - converts our postcode. 
  But we can't just write this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim ConvertPostcode As String<br>
  ConvertPostcode = StrConv( TextBox1.Text, VbStrConv.UpperCase )<br>
  TextBox1.Text = ConvertPostcode</p>
<p>That would be all right for the button on our Form. But it's not all right 
  for our Class. When you're designing a Class, your code has to go inside of 
  things like Functions and Subs. You'll also see how to create your own properties 
  for your objects.</p>
<p>When you set up a Function or Sub, you're actually creating Methods for your 
  objects (A Method is code that actually does something, that performs an action. 
  Converts a postcode in our case.) We'll see how to do that next.</p>
