<p><i>This tutorial is part of an ongoing lesson. The first part is here: <a href="nets11p2.html">Create 
  your own Classes in VB .NET</a></i></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="nets11p2.html">previous sections</a>, you have learned how 
  to create a Class in VB .NET. You also learned how to create your own Methods. 
  In this part, you'll learn how to create your own properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Creating your own Properties in VB .NET Classes</h3>
<p>You can add your own Properties to your Class. A Property, remember, is something 
  that changes or sets a value. Examples are, setting the Text in a textbox, changing 
  the background colour of a Form, and setting a Button to be Enabled.</p>
<p>You can Get values from a Property or Set them. So for a Textbox, you can Set 
  the text to appear in the textbox, or you can Get what text is inside of the 
  textbox. You use these same words, Get and Set, when you're creating your own 
  Properties. An example might clear things up. Before you do the following, download 
  the image you will need for this tutorial: </p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/planet.zip">Download the image for these tutorials 
  (WinZip file)</a></p>
<p>Once you have the images on your hard drive, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Add a Picture Box control to your Form</li>
  <li>Set the <b>SizeMode</b> Property of the Picture box to <b>StretchImage</b></li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Image</b> Property, and add the <b>planet.jpg</b> image 
    that you downloaded above</li>
  <li> Add two textboxes to the form. Change the Name of the first one to <b>txtHeight</b>, 
    and the second one to <b>txtWidth</b>. Enter <b>300</b> as a the text for 
    both textboxes</li>
  <li>Add two labels to the form. Set the <b>Text</b> of the first one to <b>Height</b>, 
    and the second one to <b>Width</b>. Move them next to the textboxes</li>
  <li>Add a new button to your form. Set the <b>Text</b> property to &#147;Change 
    Height and Width&#148; </li>
</ul>
<p>What we&#146;ll do is to give our object the capability of setting a Height 
  and Width property. When the object has done its work, the height and width 
  of the picture box will change to the values from the textboxes. Off we go then.</p>
<p>VB needs to know that you want to set up a Property for your Class. The way 
  you do this is type &quot;Public Property &#133; End Property&quot;. </p>
<p>Access the code for your Class. Type a few lines of space between the End Sub 
  of your DoMessageBox Method, and the line that reads &quot;End Class&quot;. 
  On a new line, type the following:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Public Property ChangeHeight() As Integer</b></p>
<p><b>ChangeHeight</b> is the name of our property, and it's something we made 
  up ourselves. After a pair of round brackets, you add the type of value that 
  will be returned (Just like a function). Here, we want to return an Integer 
  value.</p>
<p>When you press the return key after typing that line, VB finishes off the rest 
  of the code stub for you:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Public Property ChangeHeight() As Integer</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">Get</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">End Get</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">Set(ByVal Value As Integer)</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">End Set</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Property</p>
<p>Before the code is explained, add a new variable right at the top of your code, 
  just below &quot;Public Class changeHeightWidth&quot;. Add this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Private intHeight As Integer</b></p>
<p>The Private word means that only code inside of the Class can see this variable. 
  You can't access this code directly from a button on a Form, for example.</p>
<p>The reason the variable is right at the top is so that other chunks of code 
  can see and use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="links_ads"><a href="../bookshop/net.html">No more reading these lessons 
  online - get the eBook here!</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But your coding window should now look something like this next image:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/AddClassProps.gif" alt="The code for your Class" border="1"></p>
<p>With the <b>Get</b> and <b>Set</b> parts, the Property stub is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Public Property PropertyName() As VaraibleType</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Property</p>
<p>The reason the <b>Get</b> and <b>Set</b> are there is so that you can Set a 
  value for your property, and get a value back out.</p>
<p>To Set a value, the code inside of Property is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Set( ByVal Value As Integer )</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Set</p>
<p align="left">The Set word is followed by a pair of round brackets. Inside of 
  the round brackets is <b>ByVal Value As Integer</b>. The is just like a Sub, 
  when you hand over a value to it. The name of the variable, <b>Value</b>, is 
  a default name. You can change this to anything you like. The type of variable, 
  <b>As Integer</b>, is also a default. You don't have to pass numbers to you 
  property. If you want your Property to handle text you might have something 
  like this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Set( ByVal MyText As String )</b></p>
<p>But you couldn't do this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Set( ByVal Value As Integer, ByVal MyString As String )</b></p>
<p>In other words, you can't pass two values to your property. You can only pass 
  one value.</p>
<p>But we want to pass a number to our property. For us, this value will come 
  from the textbox on the form. Whatever number is inside of the textbox will 
  get handed over to our Property.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Set( ByVal Value As Integer )</b></p>
<p>But we need to use this value being handed over. We can assign it to that variable 
  we set up at the top of the Class. So add this to your code (The new line is 
  in bold):</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue_no_bold">Set(ByVal Value As Integer)</P>
<P class="indent_big_blue">intHeight = Value</P>
<P class="indent_small_blue_no_bold">End Set</p>
<p>Whenever our Property is called into action, we're setting a <b>Value</b>, 
  and then handing that value to a variable called <b>intHeight</b>. This is known 
  as Writing to a Property.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">To read from a Property, you use Get. This will Get a value back 
  out of your Property. The code stub is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Get</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Get</p>
<p>You don't need any round brackets for the Get part. You're just fetching something 
  to be read.</p>
<p>Add the line in bold text to your Get statement.</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue_no_bold">Get</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">ChangeHeight = intHeight</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue_no_bold">End Get</p>
<p>All you're doing here is returning a value, just like you do with a function. 
  You're handing a value to whatever name you called your property. We called 
  ours <b>ChangeHeight</b>. It's an Integer. So we can pass whatever value was 
  stored inside of <b>intHeight</b> over to the variable called <b>ChangeHeight</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><b>ChangeHeight = intHeight</b></p>
<p>You can also use the Return keyword. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue_no_bold">Get</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">Return intHeight</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue_no_bold">End Get</p>
<p>Let's see how to use our new Property. (It's not a terribly useful property, 
  by the way. A Picture box already has a Height and Width property that you can 
  use. So ours is a bit redundant. But we're keeping it simple so that you can 
  understand how to create your own properties. And it's not a good idea to put 
  this Property into the code for your ConvertPostcode Class. After all, what 
  has the height and width of a picture box got to do with postcodes? But we've 
  added it here just for convenience sake.)</p>
