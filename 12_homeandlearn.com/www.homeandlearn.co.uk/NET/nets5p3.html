<H1 ID="Article">Runtime errors in VB .NET</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<p align="center">This lesson is part of an ongoing tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="nets5p2.html">Design Time Errors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Runtime errors</b> are a lot harder than Design Time errors to track down. 
  As their name suggests, these errors occur when the programme is running. Runtime 
  errors are the ones that crash your programme. A simple way to crash a programme 
  is to divided by zero. Change the code for your button to this, and try it out:</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">Dim Num1 As Integer<br>
  Dim Num2 As Integer</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">Num1 = 10<br>
  Num2 = 0</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">TextBox1.Text = CInt(Num1 / Num2)</p>
<p>The <b>CInt( )</b> part means Convert to an Integer. We're just making sure 
  to convert the answer to the sum into a number. But run your programme and test 
  it out. Click your button and see what happens.</p>
<p>What happens is that you'll get the following error message popping up in Visual 
  Studio Express 2010:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/OverflowError.gif" alt="The Overflow Error"></p>
<P>In version 2012, you'll get the following error message (the 2010 version seems 
  more helpful, and better designed):</p>
<P align="center"><img src="images/vb_2012/chapter_error/divide_by_zero.gif" alt="Error message in VB NET 2012"></p>
<P>Click the Break button, and then stop your programme from running.</p>
<p>When you try to divide by zero, VB.NET throws up the <b>Overflow</b> error 
  message - there would be just too many zeros to go into the <b>Integer</b> variable 
  type. Even if you change the Type into a <b>Single</b> or a <b>Double</b>, you'd 
  still get the same error message. Programming environments just don't like you 
  dividing a number by zero. If this were in a real programme, chances are it 
  would crash, or &quot;bug out&quot;. And you'll get the blame!</p>
<p>If you think the answer to a calculation could result in zero, you should check 
  for this. We'll see how to write code to trap Runtime errors in a moment. But 
  here's another example of one.</p>
<p>From the controls toolbox, add a RichTextBox control to your form. Change the 
  <b>Name</b> property of your <b>RichTextBox</b> to <b>rt1</b>. A RichTextBox 
  is just like a normal textbox but with more functionality. One of these extra 
  functions is the ability to load a file directly. Delete or comment out any 
  code you have for your button, and add the following line:</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">rt1.LoadFile(&quot;C:\test10.txt&quot;, RichTextBoxStreamType.PlainText)</p>
<p>However, if you are using Vista or windows 7 then change the file name above 
  to this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&quot;C:\Users\Owner\Documents\test10.txt&quot;</b><br>
</p>
<p>All the line does is to load (or try to) the text file called &quot;<b>test10.txt</b>&quot; 
  into the RichTextBox. The second argument just specifies that the type of file 
  we want to load is a Plain Text file.</p>
<p>Run your programme, and then click the button. If you don't have a text file 
  called &quot;test10.txt&quot; in the root folder of your C drive, you'll get 
  the following Runtime error message:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/errorFileNotFound.gif" alt="The File Not Found error"></p>
<P>The additional information is quite useful this time. It's saying that the 
  file &quot;C:\test10.txt&quot; could not be found. If the error occurred in 
  a normal programme, it would shut down. Not something you want a programme to 
  do in mid stream! But let's see how to deal with it.</p>
<P>In the next part we take a look at Try ... Catch in order to trap any errors 
  in your code.</p>
