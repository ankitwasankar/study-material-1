  <p align="center">This lesson is part of an ongoing tutorial. This first part 
    is here: <a href="nets6p1-2.html">What is an Array?</a></p>
  <p>There are a number of way you can put data into each position of an array. 
    The code we <a href="nets6p2-2.html">just wrote </a>for the two buttons had 
    known values stored into each position. We knew we that we wanted the numbers 
    1 to 5 to be stored into our Integer array, and we knew that we wanted the 
    text &quot;This is a String Array&quot; stored into our String array. </p>
  <p>But you don't have to know what the values are. You can assign values straight 
    from a Textbox into the position of your array. Like this:</p>
  <p class="indent_small_blue">MyNumbers(0) = Val(Textbox1.Text)<br>
    MyNumbers(1) = Val(Textbox2.Text)<br>
    etc </p>
  <p>With that code, whatever you typed into the Textboxes on your Form would 
    be stored into the positions of your array. The same would be true of a String 
    Array:</p>
  <p class="indent_small_blue">MyNumbers(0) = Textbox1.Text<br>
    MyNumbers(1) = Textbox2.Text<br>
    etc</p>
  <p>But do we have to keep typing out a value for each and every position of 
    our array. What if we had an array with a hundred items in it, <b>MyText(99)</b>? 
    Would we have to type out text for all one hundred positions of the array? 
  </p>
  <p>Well, obviously not. You can use code to assign values to your array. Here 
    is an example where we don't type out values for all positions of an array. 
    It's the times table again. This time we'll use an array. And we'll write 
    a line of code to assign values to each position of the array.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, add another <b>Button</b> to your form.</li>
  <li>Set the <b>Text</b> Property to &quot;<b>Times TableArray</b>&quot;</li>
  <li>Add a <b>Textbox</b> to your Form</li>
  <li>Set the <b>Text</b> Property to a blank string (in other words, delete Textbox1 from the Text property)</li>
  <li>Add a <b>Label</b> near the Textbox</li>
  <li>Set the <b>Text</b> property of the Label to &quot;<b>Which Times Table do you want?</b>&quot;</li>
  <li>Now double click your new button to get at the code window. Add the following code:</li>
</ul>
 
  <p class="indent_small_blue">Dim numbers(10) As Integer<br>
    Dim times As Integer<br>
    Dim StoreAnswer As Integer<br>
    Dim i As Integer</p>
	
  <p class="indent_small_blue">ListBox1.Items.Clear()</p>
  <p class="indent_small_blue">times = Val(TextBox1.Text)</p>
  <p class="indent_small_blue">For i = 1 To 10</p>
  <p class="indent_small_blue">StoreAnswer = i * times</P>
    <P class="indent_big_blue">numbers(i) = StoreAnswer<br>
    ListBox1.Items.Add(times &amp; &quot; times &quot; 
    &amp; i &amp; &quot; = &quot; &amp; numbers(i))</p>
  <p class="indent_small_blue">Next i</p>
  <p>Run the programme. Enter a number in your new text box, and then click the 
    <b>Times Table Array</b> button. The times table for the number should have 
    been printed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="links_ads"><a href="../bookshop/net-2.html">No more reading these lessons online - get the eBook here!</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the top of the code we set up three normal Integer variables, <b>i,</b> 
    <b>times</b> and <b>StoreAnswer</b>. (We didn't really need the StoreAnswer 
    variable, but it is here to make the code more readable.) We also set up an 
    array. (Notice that we set it to 10. This actually gives us 11 positions in 
    the array. But we're only putting something in positions 1 to 10. This is 
    because it is more convenient for us, and for our Loop.)</p>
  <p class="indent_bigger">Dim numbers(10) As Integer</p>
  <p>We need to know what number we are going to be multiplying by, which times 
    table we're working out. We get this number from the Textbox, and can assign 
    it directly to the variable times</p>
  <p class="indent_bigger">times = Val(Textbox1.Text)</p>
  <p>We can then set up a For Loop. Inside the For Loop is where we'll assign 
    values to each position of our array:</p>
  <p class="indent_bigger">numbers(i) = StoreAnswer</p>
  <p>First time around the loop, the variable i will hold a value of 1. So the 
    second position of our array, <b>numbers(1)</b> will be assigned whatever 
    is in the variable <b>StoreAnswer</b></p>
  <p>The second time around the loop, the variable <b>i </b>will hold a value 
    of 2. So the second position of our array, <b>numbers(2)</b>, will again be 
    assigned whatever is in the variable <b>StoreAnswer</b></p>
  <p>We go round and round the loop assigning values to all ten positions of our 
    array.</p>
  <p>The other two lines of code inside the array just work out the times tables, 
    and <b>Adds</b> the answer to the List Box. Study them, and make sure you 
    understand how they work. </p>
  <p>But the point of this is to demonstrate that you can use code to assign a 
    value to a position in an array.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the next part, we'll take a look at situations where you don't know how 
    many items will be in an array.</p>
