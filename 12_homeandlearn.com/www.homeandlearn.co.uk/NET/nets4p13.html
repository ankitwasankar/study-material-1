  <p>Two more useful controls in the Visual Basic toolbox are the Check box and 
    the Option Button. You use these when you want to give your users a choice 
    of options. We'll add both of these to a new Form, and then combine them with 
    a Select Case statement to read what the user has chosen.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Check Boxes</h3>
  <p>So start a new project. Locate the Checkbox control in the toolbox. Double 
    click the control and a Checkbox appears on your new Form</p>
  <p>You'll see that the Checkbox has the Text property of CheckBox1 by default, 
    and a Name of CheckBox1. If you were to double click again on the Checkbox 
    icon in the toolbox, the new control would be called CheckBox2. </p>
  <p>The problem with this approach is that by double clicking each Checkbox, 
    you have several individual Checkboxes. And if you wanted to move them around 
    you'd have to move each Checkbox separately. There is a way to group all your 
    Check Boxes together, and move them around as one - by using a <b>Group Box</b>. 
    (You can use a Panel control as well, but we'll stick with the Group Box.)</p>
  <p>So, click on your Checkbox with the right mouse button. From the menu that 
    pops up, select delete to get rid of it.</p>
  <p>Now locate the <b>Group Box</b> control in the toolbox:</p>
  
<p align="center"><img src="images/groupBox_p132.gif" border="1"></p>
  <p> It's better to draw this one on the form, rather than dragging and dropping. 
    When you've added one, the only thing you should have on your Form is a Group 
    Box. </p>
  <p>We're not going to be using many of the Properties in the Group Box Property 
    box. But click on your Group Box to select it, and change to the Text Property 
    to &quot;Soaps&quot;. Change the Font Property to anything you like. You should 
    now have a Form like this one</p>
  
<p align="center"><img src="images/CheckBoxForm.gif" alt="A Group Box on a VB .NET form"></p>
  <P>The Group Box we just added will hold our Checkboxes. It acts 
    as a container for the controls. To move the Checkboxes about, we can just 
    click on the Group Box to select it, and drag and drop the Group Box somewhere 
    else. The Checkboxes will all move with the Group Box. Let's add some Checkboxes 
    to it.</p>
  <p>You CAN'T double click a checkbox and add it to a Group Box. The only way 
    to add a control to a Group Box is to draw one on the Group Box.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click once with your left mouse button on the <b>Checkbox</b> icon in the VB toolbox</li>
  <li>Move your mouse pointer over to the inside of the 
      <b>Group Box</b>. The mouse pointer will change to a cross</li>
  <li>Hold down you left mouse button inside the Group Box. 
      Keep the button held down, and drag outwards. Release the left button when 
      you're happy with the size. You can always resize it later.</li>
  <li>Add 5 Checkboxes to your Group Box</li>
  <li>Change the <b>Text</b> property of each of your Checkboxes 
      to any five Soap Operas. Your Form should now look something like the one below:</li>
</ol>

  
<p align="center"><img src="images/CheckBoxForm2.gif" alt="What your form should look like now"></p>
  <p>Run your programme to test it out. Click inside a Checkbox to 
    select an item. Click again to deselect it. When you've finished, return to 
    the Design Environment and click on the Group Box itself to select it. Make 
    sure the Group Box IS selected, and not one of your Checkboxes. You can now 
    drag the Group Box around your Form and all the Checkboxes will move with 
    it.</p>
  <p>The point about having Checkboxes is to offer your users multiple choices. 
    We'll now write some code to get the choices made by the user. All the Checkboxes 
    with ticks inside them will have their Text displayed in a Message Box.</p>
  <p>We'll do that in the next part of this tutorial.</p>
