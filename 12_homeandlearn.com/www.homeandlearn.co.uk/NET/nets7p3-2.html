<h3>Char ( NOT Chars)</h3>
<p><b>Char</b> is a variable type. It can hold one character at a time (the Char 
  is short for Character). You set it up like this:</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">Dim OneCharacter As Char</p>
<p>You can then store a character in the variable like this:</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">OneCharacter = &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">Dim OneCharacter As Char = &quot;a&quot;</p>
<p>You can even do this:</p>
<p class="indent_bigger">Dim OneCharacter As Char = &quot;apple&quot;</p>
<p>But if you try to put a whole word into a Char variable, only the first letter 
  will be retained. </p>
<p>So what good is the Char variable type?</p>
<p>Well, a common use for it is to transfer one letter at a time from a string, 
  and then test to see what this character is. You can test to see if it's a number, 
  for example. Or perhaps to test if the string contains an &quot;@&quot; symbol 
  for a valid email address. We'll test for a number. In the process, we can study 
  the Length property of string variables.</p>
<p>Add another textbox and a button to your form from the <a href="nets7p1-2.html">first 
  part of the tutorial</a>. Change the <b>Name</b> property of the textbox to 
  <b>txtChars</b>. For the <b>Text</b> property of the Textbox, enter &quot;<b>George123</b>&quot;. 
  Double click the new button and enter the following variable declarations:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim OneCharacter As Char<br>
  Dim FirstName As String<br>
  Dim i As Integer<br>
  Dim TextLength As Integer</p>
<p>Remember what we're going to be doing here. We're going to put the text from 
  the textbox into a string variable. Then we'll loop round every character in 
  the string to see if it's a number.</p>
<p>So the next line to add to your code is the one that transfers the text from 
  the textbox to the string variable. Add this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">FirstName = Trim(txtChars.Text)</p>
<p>The next thing we need is the length of the string. We need this for the end 
  value of our loop. The length property will give us this answer. So add this 
  line:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">TextLength = FirstName.Length</p>
<p>The length property of a string variable tells you how many characters are 
  in the string. You can add a message box to test out your code so far:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">MsgBox(&quot;Number of characters is: &quot; &amp; 
  TextLength)</p>
<p>Run your programme. Click the button and test out your code. You should see 
  a message box popping up like this one:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Charmsgbox-2.gif" alt="A message box"></p>
<p>So we've found out that &quot;<b>George123</b>&quot; has 9 characters.</p>
<p>We can now loop round each character in the string and test which ones are 
  the numbers. Add the following For loop to your code (you can delete or comment 
  out your message box line now):</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">For i = 0 To TextLength - 1</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Next i</p>
<p>So the For loop starts at zero and ends at the length of the text, minus 1. 
  (It will loop from 0 to 8 in our code - 9 characters. We'll see why you have 
  to deduct 1 soon.</p>
<p>Inside of our loop, we need to grab one character at a time, and then put it 
  into our <b>Char</b> variable. You can do that with the <b>Chars()</b> Property 
  of the string variable type.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chars (NOT Char)</h3>
<p><b>Chars</b> is a method of the String variable type. You can use it on any 
  length of string, not just a Char variable. And that's the difference between 
  the two: Char is a variable type, while <b>Chars</b> is a method you can use 
  on Strings.</p>
<p><b>Chars</b> works like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">OneCharacter = FirstName.Chars(i)</p>
<p>You type the name of your variable, then after the full stop you add <b>Chars()</b>. 
  Inside of the round brackets, you need a number. This number is the position 
  in the string you want to grab. So if you wanted the third letter of a string 
  variable, you'd put this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim SomeString As String<br>
  Dim OneCharacter As Char</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">SomeString = &quot;George123&quot;<br>
  OneCharacter = SomeString.Chars(2)</p>
<p>The variable <b>OneCharacter</b> would then hold the third letter - &quot;<b>o</b>&quot;. 
</p>
<p>The reason we've put 2 inside of the round brackets and not 3 is because VB 
  starts counting the characters from zero, and NOT 1. And that's why our For 
  Loop is this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">For i = 0 To TextLength - 1</p>
<p>You have to deduct 1 because the Chars() count starts at zero.</p>
<p>So amend your For Loop to this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">For i = 0 To TextLength - 1</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">OneCharacter = FirstName.Chars(i)<br>
  MsgBox(OneCharacter)</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Next i</p>
<p>Run your code, and then click your button. You should get a message box displaying. 
  In fact, you'll get 9 message boxes, one for each character in the string!</p>
<p>Ok, try these exercises to test your new knowledge.<br>
</p>
<h3>Exercise K</h3>
<p>Add an If statement to your For Loop. Check each character of the string &quot;<b>George123</b>&quot;. 
  If you find a number, display a suitable message, something like &quot;A number 
  was found&quot;. Exit the for loop when the first number is found.</p>
<p>To check if a variable is a number, you can use the IsNumeric( ) function. 
  This function will return either True or False. In other words, if the variable 
  being checked is a number, then IsNumeric( ) is True; if IsNumeric( ) is not 
  a number then False gets returned.</p>
<p align="center"><b>If IsNumeric(OneCharacter) Then</b></p>
<p align="right"><a href = "vb_answers-2.html#exK" target="_blank">Answer to Exercise 
  K</a></p>
<h3>Exercise L</h3>
<p>Amend your code to keep a count of how many characters in the string are numbers. 
  Display the count in a message box.</p>

<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at another useful String method - InStr.</p>
