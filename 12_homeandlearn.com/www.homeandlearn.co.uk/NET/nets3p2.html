</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<p>We've produced a video to go with this lesson. It's recommended that you read 
  the text below as well, though. The video is here:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="video_loops.html" target="_blank">Programming Loops</a></p>
This first type of loop we'll look at is called a For Loop. It is the most common 
type of loop you'll use when you programme. We'll use one to add up our 4 numbers, 
and then discuss the code. Study the following. In fact, create a new Project. 
Add a button to your new Form. Double click your new button and type the following 
code for it: 
<p class="indent_small">Dim answer As Integer<br>
  Dim startNumber As Integer</p>
<p class="indent_small">answer = 0</P>
<P class="indent_small">For startNumber = 1 To 4</P>
<P class="indent_big">answer = answer + startNumber</P>
<P class="indent_small">Next startNumber</p>
<p class="indent_small">MsgBox answer</p>
<p>Run the programme, and see what happens when you click the button. The number 
  10 should have been displayed in your message box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The For loop code</h3>
<p>We start by setting up two integer variables. We set one of these to zero. 
  Then we start our loop code. Let's examine that in more detail.</p>
<p class="indent_small">For startNumber = 1 To 4</P>
<P class="indent_big">answer = answer + startNumber</P>
<P class="indent_small">Next startNumber</p>
<p>We start our loop by telling Visual Basic what type of loop we want to use. 
  In this case it is a <b>For</b> loop:</p>
<p align="center"><b>For</b> startNumber = 1 To 4</p>
<p>The next thing you have to do is tell Visual Basic what number you want the 
  loop to start at:</p>
<p align="center">For <b>startNumber = 1 </b>To 4</p>
<p> Here we are saying &quot;Start the loop at the number 1&quot;. The variable 
  startNumber can be called anything you like. A popular name to call a start 
  loop variable is the letter i ( i = 1). So what we're doing is setting up a 
  variable - the start of the loop variable - and putting 1 into it;</p>
<p align="left">Next, you have to Tell Visual Basic what number to end the loop 
  on:</p>
<p align="center">For startNumber = 1 <b>To 4</b></p>
<p align="left">The <b>To</b> word, followed by a number or variable, tells Visual 
  Basic how many times you want the loop to go round and round. We're telling 
  Visual Basic to loop until the startNumber variable equals 4</p>
<p>The command that tells Visual basic to grab the next number in the sequence 
  is this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Next startNumber</b></p>
<p>When Visual Basic reaches this line, it checks to see what is in the variable 
  startNumber. It then adds one to it. In other words, &quot;Get me the next number 
  after the one I've just used.&quot;</p>
<p>The next thing that happens is that Visual Basic will return to the word <b>For</b>. 
  It returns because it's in a loop. It needs to know if it can stop looping. 
  To check to see if it can stop looping, it skips the startNumber = 1 part, and 
  then jumps to your end number. In our case, the end number was 4. Because <b>Next 
  startNumber</b> adds one to whatever is in startNumber, then startNumber is 
  now 2 (It was 1 at the start. The next number after one is ... ?). </p>
<p>So if startNumber is now 2, can Visual Basic stop looping? No it can&#146;t. 
  Because we&#146;ve told it to loop until it reaches number 4. It&#146;s only 
  reached number 2, so off it goes on another trip around the loop. When the startNumber 
  is greater than the end number, Visual Basic drops out of the loop and continues 
  on it&#146;s way.</p>
<p>But remember why we're looping: so that we can execute some code over and over 
  again.</p>
<p>To clarify things, change the above code to this:</p>
<p class="indent_small">Dim startNumber As Integer</p>
<p class="indent_small">For startNumber = 1 To 4</p>
<p class="indent_big">MsgBox(&quot;Start Number = &quot; &amp; startNumber)</p>
<p class="indent_small">Next startNumber</p>
<p>Run the programme, and click your button. What happens? You should have seen 
  this in the message box, one after the other:</p>
<p class="indent_big">Start Number = 1<br>
  Start Number = 2<br>
  Start Number = 3<br>
  Start Number = 4</p>
<p>Each time round the loop, the code for the message box was executed. You had 
  to click OK four times - startNumber = 1 To 4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>So to sum up:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A For loop needs a start position and an end position, and all on the same 
    line</li>
  <li> A For loop also needs a way to get the next number in the loop</li>
  <li> A loop without any code to execute looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent_big">For i = startNumber To endNumber</P>
<P class="indent_big">Next i</p>
<p>The above code uses two variables for the start and end numbers. The start 
  number for the loop goes directly into the variable called <B>i</B>. When Visual 
  Basic wants the next number, it just add one to whatever is in the variable 
  <B>i</B>. You could use it like this:</p>
<p class="indent_big">Dim startNumber As Integer<br>
  Dim endNumber As Integer<br>
  Dim i As Integer</P>
<P class="indent_big">startNumber = 1 <BR>
  endNumber = 4</p>
<p class="indent_big">For i = startNumber To endNumber</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">Msgbox i</P>
<P class="indent_big">Next i</p>
<p>Change the code for your button to that new code, and test it out. Study the 
  code so that you understand what is going on.</p>
<p>For Loops might not be easier to understand than just typing <b>answer = 1 
  + 2 + 3 + 4</b>, but they are a lot more powerful if you want to add up a thousand 
  numbers!</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Put two textboxes on your form. The first box asks users to enter a start position 
  for a For Loop; the second textbox asks user to enter an end position for the 
  For loop. When a button is clicked, the programme will add up the numbers between 
  the start position and the end position. Display the answer in a message box. 
  You can use this For Loop code</p>
<P class="indent_big">For i = startNumber To endNumber</P>
<P class="indent_bigger">answer = answer + i</p>
<p class="indent_big">Next i</p>
<p>Get the <b>startNumber</b> and <b>endNumber</b> from the textboxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Exercise H</h3>
<p>Amend your code to check that the user has entered numbers in the textboxes. 
  You will need an If statement to do this. If there's nothing in the textboxes, 
  you can halt the programme with this code</p>
<p align="center"><b>Exit Sub</b></p>
<p>For this exercise, you will be passing whatever is in the textboxes to integer 
  variables. It is these variables you are checking with your If Statement. Because 
  numbers will be entered into the textboxes, remember to convert the text to 
  a value with Val( ). </p>
<p>But the Text property will return a zero if the box is empty. So your If statement 
  will need to check the variables for a value of zero. If it finds a zero, Then 
  you can use the Exit Sub code. The If statement should come first, before the 
  For Loop code.</p>

<p>This has been quite a long section, and you may need a breather! Don't worry 
  if you don't understand all that in one sitting. Come back to it, and it will 
  sink in - eventaully! In the next section, we'll take a look at Do Loops.</p>
