<p align="center">This lesson is part of an ongoing tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="nets5p2.html">Design Time Errors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <a href="nets5p5.html">the last part</a>, you added some code to a button. 
  All the code does is try and count how many times the letter &quot;g&quot; appeared 
  in the word &quot;Debugging&quot;. We saw that the programme failed to do this, 
  and came up with the answer zero. To help you find out what went wrong, there 
  is a tool in VB .NET called a Breakpoint. Let's see what this is, and how to 
  use Breakpoints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Breakpoints</h3>
<p> A breakpoint is like a note to VB.NET to stop your programme at a particular 
  place. You add one to your code by clicking in the margins. A brown circled 
  then appears, indicating where the code will break. The following two images 
  show how to add one:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint.gif" alt="Click in the margins to add a Breakpoint" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">When you click in the margins, to the left of a line of code, 
  a brown circle appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint2.gif" alt="A Breakpoint has been added" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">Notice that the line where you want VB.NET to break is highlighted 
  brown. </p>
<p>Run your programme, and click the button. You are immediately returned to the 
  coding window. The place where you put the Breakpoint will now have a yellow 
  arrow on top of the brown circle. The brown highlighted line will now be yellow:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint3.gif" alt="The Breakpoint is now highlighted in yellow" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">The yellow highlight indicates where in your code VB.NET is. To 
  continue checking your code, press F10 on your keyboard (you can also press 
  F11, but this will jump into any Subs or Functions you've set up.)</p>
<p>The next line in your code will be highlighted:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint4.gif" alt="The programme has advanced to the next line" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">The yellow arrow, and the yellow highlight, jump down one line. 
  Press the F10 key again. Then hold you mouse on the letter variable. The value 
  this variable currently holds will be displayed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint5.jpg" alt="Hold your mouse over a variable"></p>
<p align="left">The first time round the loop, the value in <b>letter</b> is &quot;e&quot; 
  (The &quot;c&quot; next to it means that the variable type is Character). </p>
<p>If the &quot;e&quot; of &quot;Debugging&quot; is getting checked first, what 
  happened to the &quot;D&quot;? Straight away, this indicates a problem. And 
  the problem is that the Substring method starts counting from zero. So halt 
  your programme by clicking &quot;<b>Debug &gt; Stop Debugging</b>&quot;, or 
  click the <b>Stop</b> icon on the toolbar. Change the line in question to this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>letter = strText.Substring(0)</b></p>
<p>Run your programme again, and click the button. When you are returned to your 
  code, press the F10 key and check the value of the letter variable. It should 
  now be this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint6.jpg" alt="Hold your mouse over the variable again"></p>
<p align="left">This time, the code is catching the first letter of the word when 
  the loop begins, and not the second one. </p>
<p>Is that it? Have we found the cause of our problems? Stop your programme. Click 
  on the brown circle to get rid of the Breakpoint. Run it again, and see what 
  happens.</p>
<p>The number of G's counted is still zero! So the logic error has not yet been 
  tracked down. Create another Breakpoint at the same place, and try again.</p>
<p>You can continue pressing the F10 key until you've spotted the error. Or you 
  can use another debugging tool - the Locals window.</p>
<p>While your programme is still in Debug mode (the yellow line will still be 
  there, if it is), click <b>Debug &gt; Windows &gt; Locals</b> from the menu 
  bar. You should see the following in the bottom left of your screen:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint7.gif" alt="The locals window"></p>
<p align="left">Locals means &quot;Local variables&quot;. That is, variables declared 
  in this section of the code. The variables <b>i</b>, <b>letter</b> and <b>LetterCount</b> 
  are showing in the window. The value of these variables is also displayed: <b>0</b>, 
  <b>Nothing</b> and <b>0</b>. Press F10 and these values will change. This is 
  the Locals window after one go round the loop:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/breakpoint8.gif" alt="Press the F10 key to advance the programme"></p>
<p align="left">The variable <b>i</b> is now <b>2</b>; letter is &quot;<b>D</b>&quot;, 
  and <b>LetterCount</b>, is still <b>0</b>. Keep pressing F10 and go round the 
  loop a few times. What do you notice?</p>
<p>You should notice that the value in letter never moves on. It is &quot;D&quot; 
  all the time. And that's why LetterCount never gets beyond 0. <br>
</p>
<h3 align="left">Exercise J</h3>
<p>Why does <b>LetterCount</b> never gets beyond 0? Correct the code so that your 
  textbox displays the correct answer of 3 when the programme is run.</p>
<p align ="right"><a href = "vb_answers.html#exJ" target="_blank">Answer to Exercise J</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's it for Error checking and debugging. It can often be an art form 
  in itself. But one well worth persevering with: it could save you a lot of headaches!</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll move on and have a look at what arrays are.</p>
