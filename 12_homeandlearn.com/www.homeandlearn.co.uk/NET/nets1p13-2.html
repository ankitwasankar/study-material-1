</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we've learnt something about variables, what they are and how to set one 
  up. We learnt about the word &quot;integer&quot;, and that integer variables 
  held numbers. But what if we don't want numbers? After all, our first Form asked 
  users to type in their First Name and Last Name. Names are not numbers, so what 
  do we do then? Well that's where Strings come in. </p>
<p>What is a String? Actually a string is nothing more than text. And if we want 
  Visual Basic to store text we need to use the word &quot;String&quot;. To set 
  up a variable to hold text we need to use As String and not As Integer. If the 
  information we want to store in our variables is a First Name and a Last Name, 
  we can set up two variables like this.</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim FirstName As String<br>
  Dim LastName As String</p>
<p>Again we've started with the Dim word. Then we've called the first variable 
  FirstName. Finally, we've ended the line by telling Visual Basic that we want 
  to store text in the variable - As String.</p>
<p>So we've set up the variables. But there is nothing stored in them yet. We 
  store something in a variable with the equals sign ( = ). Let's store a first 
  name and a last name in them</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">FirstName = &quot;Bill&quot;<br>
  LastName = &quot;Gates&quot;</p>
<p>Here, we said to Visual Basic &quot;Store the word 'Bill' into the variable 
  FirstName and store the word 'Gates' into the variable called LastName. But 
  pay attention to the quotation marks surrounding the two words. We didn't say 
  Bill, we said &quot;Bill&quot;. Visual Basic needs the two double quotation 
  marks before it can identify your text, your String. </p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#000000"><i>So remember: if you're storing text 
  in a variable, don't forget the quotation marks!</i></font></b></p>
<P>To test all this out, add a new Button to your Form. Set the Text property 
  of the Button to &quot;String Test&quot;. Your Form would then look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/FormStrings-2.gif" alt="VB Net Form to test string variables"></p>
<P>Double click your new button, and add the following code:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim FirstName As String<br>
  Dim LastName As String<br>
  Dim FullName As String</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">FirstName = &quot;Bill&quot;<br>
  LastName = &quot;Gates&quot;</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">FullName = FirstName &amp; LastName</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Textbox1.Text = FullName</p>
<p><br>
  Your code window should now look like this (some of the first line has been 
  cropped in the image below):<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/CodeWindowButtonTwo-2.gif" alt="VB .NET code window" border="1"></p>
<P>There's a line there that needs explaining</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">FullName = FirstName &amp; LastName</p>
<p>In the two lines of code above that one, we stored the string &quot;Bill&quot; 
  and the string &quot;Gates&quot; into two variables. What we're doing now is 
  joining those two variables together. We do this with the ampersand symbol ( 
  &amp; ). The ampersand is used to join strings together. It's called Concatenation.</p>
<p>Once Visual Basic has joined the two strings together (or concatenated them), 
  we're saying &quot;store the result in the variable called FullName&quot;. After 
  that, we tell VB to display the result in our Textbox.</p>
<p>So, once you've typed the code, start your programme and test it out.</p>
<P>Once the programme is running, Click the Button and see what happens. You should 
  have a Form that looks something like this one:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/FormStrings2-2.gif" alt="The name appears in the text box"></p>
<P>The textbox displays the text stored in our variables, &quot;Bill&quot; and 
  &quot;Gates&quot;. We joined them together with the ampersand ( &amp; ). But 
  as you can see, the two words are actually joined as one. We can add a bit of 
  space between the two words by using another ampersand. Change this line <b>FullName 
  = FirstName &amp; LastName</b> to this:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">FullName = FirstName &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; LastName</p>
<p>What we're saying here is join this lot together: the variable called FirstName 
  and a single blank space and the variable called LastName. When you've finished 
  concatenating it all, store the result in the variable FullName.</p>
<p>Notice that we don't surround FirstName and LastName with quotation marks. 
  This is because these two are already string variables; we stored &quot;Bill&quot; 
  into FirstName and &quot;Gates&quot; LastName. So VB already knows that they 
  are text.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Remove one of the ampersand symbols (&amp;) from this line in your code:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">FullName = FirstName &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; LastName</p>
<p>Move your cursor down a line or two. You should see that part of your code 
  has a wiggly blue line under it:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/wigglyLine-2.jpg" alt="Synatx error in VB NET" border="1"></p>
<P>VB is telling you that it has problems with this line of code. If you hold 
  your mouse over the wiggly blue line, VB tries to provide an explanation:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/wigglyLine2-2.jpg" alt="Error message" border="1"></p>
<P>The explanations VB provides are sometimes enigmatic. But you will know that 
  there is a problem. If you run the code, you'll get this popping up at you:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2012/chapter2/build_errors-2.gif" alt="Build Erros in VB NET"></p>
<P>Click the NO button. Put the ampersand back in, and all will be well.</p>
<h3 align="left">Exercise B</h3>
<p>Amend your code so that the textbox reads Gates Bill when the Command button 
  is clicked.</p>
<p align="right"><A HREF = "vb_answers-2.html#ex2" target="_blank">Answer to Exercise 
  B</A></p>
<h3>Exercise C</h3>
<p>Add another string variable to your code. The variable should hold a middle 
  name. Display the first name, the middle name and the last name in the textbox.</p>
<p align="right"><a href = "vb_answers-2.html#exC" target="_blank">Answer to Exercise 
  C</a></p>
<p> Points to remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Your variable names cannot include spaces. So the variable <b>MiddleName</b> 
    would be all right, but <b>Middle Name</b> will get you an error message </li>
  <li> When you're putting text into your new variable, don't forget the two double 
    quotes </li>
  <li> Remember to put in enough ampersands in your <b>FullName =</b> line of 
    code<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at how to asign text from a textbox into 
  our string variables.</p>
