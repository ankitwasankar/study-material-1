<p><i>This lesson is part of an ongoing tutorial. The first part is here: <a href="nets9p2-2.html">Create 
  your own Subs in VB .NET</a></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lessons, we're going to be exploring Parameters. let's get straight 
  to it.</p>
<p>Add two more textboxes to the form you created in the <a href="nets9p2-2.html">previous 
  part</a>. then do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Set the <b>Name</b> property of the first Textbox to <b>txtFirstNumber</b> 
  </li>
  <li> Set the <b>Name</b> property of the second Textbox to <b>txtSecondNumber</b> 
  </li>
  <li> Add a new button to your Form and set the <b>Text</b> property to &quot;<b>Get 
    Answer</b>&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>The two textboxes will contain numbers, one for each box. We'll write code 
  to add the two numbers together, but in our own Sub. When the button is clicked, 
  a Message Box will pop up revealing the answer to the sum of the numbers in 
  the textboxes.</p>
<p>Double click your new button to bring up the code window. Click outside of 
  the button code, just after <b>End Sub</b>, but before <b>End Class</b>. Type 
  the following code:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Private Sub AddNumbers()</P>
<P class="indent_big_blue">Dim first As Integer<br>
  Dim second As Integer<br>
  Dim answer As Integer</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">first = Val(txtFirstNumber.Text)<br>
  second = Val(txtSecondNumber.Text)</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">answer = first + second</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">MsgBox(&quot;The total is &quot; &amp; answer)</P>
<P class="indent_small_blue">End Sub</p>
<p>We have created a Sub to add together the two numbers from the Textboxes. The 
  code is very simple, and you should be able to follow it without any problems. 
</p>
<p>Now add this line to the code for your &quot;Get Answer&quot; button:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Call AddNumbers()</b></p>
<p>Run your programme. Type a number in each of the two Textboxes, and click your 
  button to make sure your programme works (did the Message Box display?) Stop 
  the programme and return to the design environment.</p>
<p>Chop the two lines of code for the Textboxes from the Sub and put them into 
  the button. Your two sections of code should now look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Sub3-2.jpg" alt="You coding window" border="1"></p>
<p align="left">The reason why there are two wiggly lines under <b>first</b> and 
  <b>Second</b> is that the AddNumbers Sub knows nothing about these two variables. 
  We've only declared one variable inside the Subroutine - <b>answer</b>. To get 
  rid of the wiggly lines, we can set up something called a Parameter. Well, two 
  parameters. </p>
<p>To put it simply, a Parameter is a value that we want to pass from one code 
  section to another. What we want to do is to pass the values we gathered from 
  our button code and hand them over to our <b>AddNumbers</b> Sub. So how do we 
  do that?</p>
<p>Change the <b>Private Sub AddNumbers()</b> line to this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Private Sub AddNumbers( </b>first As Integer<b>, </b>second 
  As Integer<b> )</b></p>
<p>When you press your return key, VB changes the part in round brackets to this 
  in versions of VB Express 2010 or less: </p>
<p align="center"><b>( ByVal first As Integer, ByVal second As Integer )</b></p>
<p>It's added a curious term - ByVal. (For 2012 users, the ByVal is hidden.) We'll 
  explain what that is in a moment. For now, concentrate on the Parameters. The 
  parameters are what we want to hand to our Subroutine. We want to hand an integer 
  variable called <b>first</b>, and an integer variable called <b>second</b>. 
  Whatever values are currently stored in these two variables will be handed to 
  our Sub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="links_ads"><a href="../bookshop/net-2.html">No more reading these lessons 
  online - get the eBook here!</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we need to change our Calling line, the one from our button. This line 
  now has a wiggly line under it, signifying that something is wrong. Remember, 
  it was this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Call AddNumbers()</b></p>
<p>If you hold your mouse over the <b>AddNumbers</b>() you might see this tip 
  appear:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Sub4-2.jpg" alt="Hold your mouse over AddNumbers" border="1"></p>
<p>What this is telling you is that your AddNumbers Sub takes some Parameters 
  (They are called Arguments when you pass them, and Parameters when they are 
  received. Because this is somewhat confusing, we'll stick to calling them Parameters.) 
  In other words, you don't have any option: if you want to call this Sub, you 
  have to add values for the parameters you set up. </p>
<p align="left">So change you Calling line to this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Call AddNumbers(<font color="#0000FF"> </font></b>first<b>, 
  </b>second<b><font color="#0000FF"> </font>)</b></p>
<p>(If the <b>second</b> inside your Sub has changed to <b>Second</b>(). Delete 
  the round brackets.)<br>
</p>
<p>Again, we use the parentheses. And in between the parentheses are our two variables. 
  They don't have to have the same names. Whatever you call your variables in 
  the AddNumbers Sub does not have to be the same names as the calling line. The 
  variable names can be entirely different. But the values in the variables get 
  passed in the order you set them up. In our case the value in the variable <b>first</b> 
  will get passed to the first variable in our AddNumbers Sub; the value in the 
  variable <b>second</b> will get passed to the next variable we set up in our 
  AddNumbers Sub.</p>
<p>Run your programme and check that it is working properly, now that you have 
  changed the calling line. When you are done, change the variable names for your 
  <b>AddNumbers</b> Sub to this (2012 users don't need to add ByVal.):</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Private Sub AddNumbers(ByVal first2 As Integer, ByVal 
  second2 As Integer)</P>
<P class="indent_big_blue">Dim answer As Integer</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">answer = first2 + second2</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">MsgBox &quot;The total is &quot; &amp; answer</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Sub</p>
<p>Here, we have changed the names in our Sub. The variable names are now different 
  from the ones in the calling line They are now <b>first2</b> and <b>second2</b>. 
  But will it still work? Test your programme out and check it. You should find 
  that it does.</p>
<p>So to sum up, we can use a Sub to create our own code segment. We use this 
  Sub just by referring to it by name. If we want to pass any values to our Sub, 
  we can set up Parameters in between the parentheses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exercise M</h3>
<p>Create a Sub to check a Textbox for a valid email address, or adapt the one 
  you already have. Pass whatever is entered in the Textbox to a variable called 
  &quot;email&quot;. Pass the value from this variable to your Sub by using a 
  Parameter. When a button is clicked, a message box should pop up telling the 
  user if the email address was wrong.</p>

<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at those two curious terms, <b>ByVal</b> 
  and <b>ByRef</b>.</p>
