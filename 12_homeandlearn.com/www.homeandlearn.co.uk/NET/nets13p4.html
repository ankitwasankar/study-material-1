<p><i>This lesson follows on from the previous short lesson: <a href="nets13p3.html">How 
  to create a second form</a></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A modal from is one that has to be dealt with before a user can continue. An 
  example is the Change Case dialogue box in Microsoft Word. If you try to click 
  away from the dialogue box, you'll here a beep to indicate an error. Until you 
  click either the Cancel or OK buttons, the programme won't let you click anywhere 
  else.</p>
<p>The second form you've <a href="nets13p3.html">just created</a> is called a 
  Modeless form. These are forms than can be hidden or sent to the taskbar. You 
  can then return to the main form or programme and do things with it.</p>
<p>A Modal form is sometimes called a dialogue box. And we'll see how to create 
  one of these now.</p>
<p>Add a second button to your Form1. Change the <b>Name</b> property of the new 
  button to <b>btnDialogueBox</b>. Double click the new button and add the following 
  code:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim frmDialogue As New frmSecond</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">frmDialogue.ShowDialog()</p>
<p>To display a form as a Modal dialogue box, you use the <b>ShowDialog</b> method. 
  If you use the Show method, the form is displayed as a Modeless form.</p>
<p>Run your programme. Click your new button, and the second form should display. 
  Move it out the way and try to click a button on Form1. You won't be able to. 
  The second form has to be dealt with before you can access Form1.</p>
<p>When the form is a Modal dialogue box, you can create OK and Cancel buttons 
  for it. VB.NET then has a trick up its sleeve for these types of buttons. We'll 
  see that trick now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>OK and Cancel Buttons</h3>
<p>In the design environment, Click the Tab for your <b>frmSecond</b>. When the 
  form is displayed in the design window, add two buttons to it (Make sure you're 
  adding the buttons to the second form and NOT Form1). Change the <b>Name</b> 
  property of the first button to <b>btnOK</b>, and the <b>Name</b> property of 
  the second to <b>btnCancel</b>. Double click your OK button and add the following 
  code to it:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Me.DialogResult = DialogResult.OK</b></p>
<p>The <b>Me</b> keyword refers to the current form. When you type a full stop, 
  select <b>DialogResult</b> from the pop up list that appears. DialogResult is 
  a property of the Form. It can accept a range of values. As soon as you type 
  a space after the equals sign, you'll see a list with these values on it (VB 
  NET 2008 only. In VB 2010, you have to type the DialogResult):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/addForm3.jpg" alt="The DialogResults list"></p>
<p>As you can see, in VB NET 2008, one of these values is <b>DialogResult.OK</b>. 
  This indicates that you want to use this button as an OK button. When the button 
  is clicked, VB.NET will return a result of OK for this button.</p>
<p>In VB NET 2010, type <b>DialogResult</b> after the equals sign. 
  Type a dot and you'll have this instead of the above image:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2010/dialogue_result_2010.gif"></p>
<p>Access the code for your Cancel button and add the following line:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Me.DialogResult = DialogResult.Cancel</b></p>
<p>For the Cancel button, we're just selecting <b>DialogResult.Cancel</b> from 
  the list. When the button is clicked, VB.NET will return a result of Cancel 
  for this button.</p>
<p>You can test to see what value is stored in <b>Me.DialogResult</b>. But you 
  do that from the button that displays the form, <b>Form1</b> for us. </p>
<p>So access your Form1 code, and locate the lines that display the second form. 
  The two lines should be these:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim frmDialogue As New frmSecond</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">frmDialogue.ShowDialog()</p>
<p>Change the second line to this:</p>

<p class="indent_small_blue">If frmDialogue.ShowDialog() = DialogResult.OK Then</P>
  <P class="indent_big_blue">MsgBox(&quot;OK Button Clicked&quot;)</P>
  <P class="indent_small_blue">End If</p>
<p>To get at the value of the button clicked, you test to see what result the 
  <b>ShowDialog</b> property is. If the <b>ShowDialog</b> property of <b>frmDialogue</b> 
  is <b>OK</b> then you can execute the code that needs executing. If the Cancel 
  button was clicked, however, you don't have to do anything: VB.NET will take 
  of closing your Modal dialogue box for you!</p>
<p>Run your programme and test it out. Click your button to bring up your Modal 
  dialogue box. Click the OK button, and you should see the message box display. 
  Bring the Modal dialogue box up a second time and then click the Cancel button. 
  The form will just close down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll see how to return values from a second form.</p>
