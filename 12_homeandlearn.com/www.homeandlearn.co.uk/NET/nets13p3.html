<p>It's a rare programme that only has one form in it. Most programmes will have 
  other forms. These other forms can be used for things like Find and Replace 
  searches, extra formatting capabilities, to set Options for the programme, and 
  a whole lot more besides. VB.NET let's you add as many forms as you want to 
  your project. But the process is not quite so simple. We'll see how to do it, 
  though.</p>
<p>You can use the form you already have for this, the one with <a href="nets13p2.html">the 
  ToolStrip</a> on it (or start a new project, if you prefer). But from the VB.NET 
  design environment, click the <b>Project</b> menu. From the drop down menu, 
  click<b> Add Windows Form</b>. The Add New Item dialogue box appears.</p>
<p>Select <b>Windows Form</b> under Templates. Then click inside the Name textbox 
  at the bottom. Change the Name of the form to <b>frmSecond.vb</b>. Then click 
  Add.<br>
</p>
<p>When you are returned to the design environment, your new form will be displayed:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/addFormED.jpg" alt="Two Forms created"><br>
</p>
<p>To switch between forms, you can click the tabs. In the image, two tabs are 
  displayed: Form1 (the original and first form), and our new form <b>frmSecond</b>.</p>
<p>We'll write code to get this new form to display. But it will only appear when 
  a button is clicked on Form1.</p>
<p>So click the tab for Form1, and add a button to this form. Change the <b>Name</b> 
  property of the button to <b>btnShowSecond</b>. Then double click the button 
  to access the code for it.</p>
<p> In order to display the second form, you have to bear in mind that Forms are 
  Classes. So <b>frmSecond</b> is a Class (as is Form1). You first have to create 
  a new object from the class called frmSecond Class. Then call its Show method. 
</p>
<p>So add this code to your button<br>
</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim SecondForm As New frmSecond</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">SecondForm.Show()</p>
<p>The first line sets up a variable called <b>SecondForm</b>. When you type &quot;<b>As 
  New</b>&quot;, you're asking VB.NET to create a New object. If you type a space, 
  you'll see a pop up list. Type the <b>frm</b> of frmSecond and you should see 
  it displayed on the list. You can double click the item in the list to add it 
  to your code. But what the line does is create a new Object from the Class called 
  <b>frmSecond</b>.</p>
<p>Once we have the Form Object stored in the variable, we can just use the Show 
  method to display the form.</p>
<p>Run your programme and test it out. When you click your button, you should 
  see the second form appear.</p>
<p>However, there's a problem with this code. Click the button again and another 
  copy of <b>frmSecond</b> appears. Keep clicking the button and your screen will 
  be filled with the second form!</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, you can move the code that creates the form 
  object. Move it right to the top of the coding window, just below <b>Public 
  Class Form1</b>.</p>
<p>The only code left in the button is the line that Shows the form. A new form 
  object will now not be created every time the button is clicked. If you try 
  it out, you should see only one form appear when the button is clicked, and 
  not multiple forms.</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll take a look at Modal and Non Modal forms.</p>
