<p align="center">This lesson is part of an ongoing tutorial. The first part is 
  here: <a href="nets7p1-2.html">String manipulation</a></p>
<p>In the <a href="nets7p1-2.html">previous part</a> you added code to transfer 
  some text that was in a Textbox over to a variable. The code you wrote was this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim FirstName As String</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">FirstName = txtFirst.Text</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">If FirstName = &quot;&quot; Then</p>
<p class="indent_big_blue">MsgBox &quot;Please enter your First Name in the text box&quot;<br>
  Exit Sub</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End If</p>
<p>But the user could press the spacebar in your textbox. Although there would 
  be no letters or numbers inthe textbox, the above error checking wouldn't work 
  - all of the blank spaces would get passed to your variable. We can use a String 
  method called Trim to solve this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Trim Method</h3>
<p>One of the methods on our list was <b>Trim</b>. What this does is to trim any 
  leading or trailing blank spaces from a string. So if the string was <b>&quot; 
  Text&quot;</b>, then Trim would delete those spaces for you, leaving just <b>&quot;Text&quot;</b>.<br>
</p>
<p>You use it in your code. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_red_no_bold">FirstName = txtFirst.Text<br>
  FirstName = FirstName.<b>Trim</b></p>
<p>First, we put the text from the textbox into a variable called <b>FirstName</b>. 
  Then we said &quot;assign to the variable <b>FirstName</b> (FirstName = ) the 
  value of <b>FirstName</b> trimmed (FirstName.Trim)&quot;.</p>
<p>Again, though, we're just adding the method we want after the variable name. 
  VB will take care of the trimming for us.</p>
<p>Another way to Trim is to use the Trim() function directly. Like this:</p>
<p class="indent_small_red_no_bold">FirstName = <b>Trim(</b> txtFirst.Text <b>)</b></p>
<p>What you are trimming here is any blank spaces from around text entered directly 
  in the text box called txtFirst </p>
<p>But we now have a way to thwart that user who is trying to trip us up by entering 
  blank spaces into our text box. If you were programming a Form where the First 
  Name was going into a database, then it's essential you trap anything like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, we've tested to see if the First Name text box was empty. Is there anything 
  else we can do? What if our clever-clogs user tries to fool us again. This time 
  he (they're always &quot;he's&quot;!) decides to enter some numbers. He claims 
  his name is &quot;<b>George12345</b>&quot;. Is there anything we can do to stop 
  his little games? Is there a way to test that the data entered into a text box 
  was text and not numbers?</p>
<p>Indeed there is! We'll use the <b>Chars</b> Property to see if we can check 
  for numbers and text. You'll also see the difference between <b>Chars</b> and 
  <b>Char</b>.</p>
