</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>Debugging your code is something you will need to do. Unless you write perfect 
  code every time, there's no getting away from it. In this section, we'll take 
  a look at ways you can track down errors using VB.NET.</P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Types of Error</h3>
<p>Programming errors are generally broken down into three types: <b>Design-time</b>, 
  <b>Runtime</b>, and <b>Logic</b> errors. </p>
<p>A <b>Design-time error</b> is also known as a syntax error. These occur when 
  the environment you're programming in doesn't understand your code. These are 
  easy to track down in VB.NET, because you get a blue wiggly line pointing them 
  out. If you try to run the programme, you'll get a dialogue box popping up telling 
  you that there were Build errors. </p>
<p><b>Runtime errors</b> are a lot harder to track down. As their name suggests, 
  these errors occur when the programme is running. They happen when your programme 
  tries to do something it shouldn't be doing. An example is trying to access 
  a file that doesn't exist. Runtime errors usually cause your programme to crash. 
  If and when that happens, you get the blame. After all, you're the programmer, 
  and you should write code to trap runtime errors. If you're trying to open a 
  database in a specific location, and the database has been moved, a Runtime 
  error will occur. It's your job to predict a thing like this, and code accordingly.</p>
<p><b>Logic errors</b> also occur when the programme is running. They happen when 
  your code doesn't quite behave the way you thought it would. A classic example 
  is creating an infinite loop of the type &quot;Do While x is greater than 10&quot;. 
  If x is always going to be greater than 10, then the loop has no way to exit, 
  and just keeps going round and round. Logic errors tend not to crash your programme. 
  But they will ensure that it doesn't work properly.</p>
<p>In the next few pages, we'll take a closer look at all three types of error.</p>
