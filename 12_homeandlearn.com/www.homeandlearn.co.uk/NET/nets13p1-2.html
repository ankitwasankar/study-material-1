  <p>In this section of the course, we'll take a look at some of the extra things 
    you can do with VB.NET forms. First, we'll take a look at the Anchor and Dock 
    properties of a form.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Anchoring and Docking</h3>
  <p>The Anchor and Dock properties of a form are two separate properties. Anchor 
    refers to the position a control has relative to the edges of the form. A 
    textbox, for example, that is anchored to the left edge of a form will stay 
    in the same position as the form is resized. Docking refers to how much space 
    you want the control to take up on the form. If you dock a control to the 
    left of the form, it will stretch itself to the height of the form, but its 
    width will stay the same. Let's take a look at some examples, to clear things 
    up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Anchoring</h3>
  <p>Start a new windows projects. Add two textboxes to your form, and set the 
    MultiLine properties of both to True. Change the height of the boxes.</p>
  <p>Click on Textbox1 and locate the Anchor property in the Properties box:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Anchor-2.jpg" alt="The Anchor Property of the Textbox"></p>
  <P>The default is to anchor the control to the Top, Left edge of 
    the form. Click the arrow to reveal a curious drop down box:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Anchor2-2.jpg" alt="The Anchor buttons"></p>
  <P>The button in the middle represents your control. The big white 
    areas are rather confusing - they don't actually do anything! To change the 
    property, you click the smaller grey or white rectangles between the big white 
    rectangle. Click again to deselect it. In the image below, the property has 
    been changed so that the textbox is anchored to the Top, Left and Right sides 
    of the form:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Anchor3-2.jpg" alt="The Textbox is anchored to the top, left, right of the Form"></p>
  <P>The next image has the textbox anchored to the Right and Bottom 
    edges of the Form:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Anchor4-2.jpg" alt="Right and Bottom anchoring"></p>
  <P>Notice where the cursor is in the images, and what has been 
    changed. Click the arrow on the drop down box to confirm your choices.</p>
  <p>To see what effect this all has, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Set the Anchor property of Textbox1 on the default of <b>Top</b>, <b>Left</b></li>
  <li>Change the Anchor property of Textbox2 to <b>None</b> (all the small rectangles should be white.)</li>
  <li>Run your programme and drag the edges of the Form outward. This will resize your form</li>
</ul>
 
  <p>What you should notice is that Textbox1 stays where it is, and that the left 
    edge of Textbox2 moves.</p>
  <p>Stop your programme from running. Change the Anchor properties of the two 
    textboxes to anything you like. Run your form again and watch what happens. 
    Try anchoring one textbox to the left and right of the form. Watch what happens.</p>
  <p>But anchoring a control to an edge of the form is a useful property to get 
    used to, if you have a form that can be resized and want your controls to 
    stay where they are.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Docking</h3>
  <p>Docking is similar to Anchoring, but this time the control fills a certain 
    area of the form. To see how it works, click on one of your textboxes and 
    locate the Dock property. Click the arrow to reveal a drop down box:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Dock-2.jpg" alt="The Dock Property"></p>
  <P>This time, all the rectangles are like buttons. You can only 
    dock to one side at a time, and the default is None. Click a button to see 
    what it does to your textbox. Click the middle one, and the textbox will Fill 
    the whole form.</p>
  <p>Docking is quite useful when used with the splitter control and panels, allowing 
    you to create a Windows-style interface.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the next part, we'll take a look at how to add a Toolbar to your Form.</p>
