  <p> You've probably noticed the area to the right of the design environment, 
    the area with all the textboxes in a grid, the one that has those daunting 
    names like &quot;AccessibleDescription&quot;, &quot;AccessibleName&quot;, 
    &quot;AccessibleRole&quot;. That's the Properties box.</p>
  <p>Click anywhere on the form that is not a label or a textbox, somewhere on 
    the form's grey areas. The form should have the little sizing handles now, 
    indicating that the form is selected.</p>
  <p>On the right of the design environment there should be the following Properties 
    box:</p>
  
<p align="center"><img src="images/Properties-2.gif" alt="The Properties area in VB NET"></p>
  <p>If your Properties box says &quot;Textbox1 Textbox&quot; or 
    &quot;Label1 Label&quot; then you haven't yet selected the Form. Click away 
    from the textbox or label until the Properties box reads &quot;Form1 Form&quot;</p>
  <p>What you are looking at is a list of the properties that a form has: Name 
    , BackColor, Font, Image, Text, etc. Just to the right of these properties 
    are the values for them. These values are the default values, and can be changed. 
    We're going to change the value of the Text property.</p>
  <p>First, you might want to display the list of Properties in a more accessible 
    form. You can display the list properties alphabetically. To do that, click 
    the Alphabetic icon at the top of the Properties box, as in the image below:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Properties2-2.gif"></p>
  <p>This will make the properties easier to find.</p>
  <p>Before we change any in the Properties box, let's clear up what we mean by 
    &quot;Property&quot;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../bookshop/net-2.html">No

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>What is a Property?</h3>
  <p>Those controls you added to the form (textboxes and labels), and the form 
    itself, are called control objects. You can think of controls as things, something 
    solid that you can pick up and move about. Controls (things) have properties. 
    If your television were a control, it too would have properties: an On/Off 
    button property, a colour property, a volume property, and a ... well, what 
    other properties would your television have? Think about it.</p>
  <p>The properties of your television will have values. The On/Off button would 
    have just two values - On or Off. The volume property could have a range of 
    values, from zero to ten, for example. If the value of the volume property 
    was set to ten, the loudest value, then you'd probably have some very angry 
    neighbours!</p>
  <p>In VB.NET, you can change a property of a control from the Properties Box. 
    (You can also change a property using code, which you'll do quite a lot.) 
    If we go back to our Form object, and the properties and values it has, we 
    can see how to change them using the Properties Box. We'll change only one 
    of these values for now - the value of the Text property . So, do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    Locate the word &quot;Text&quot; in the Property box, as in the image below
  </li>
</ul>
  
<p align="center"><img src="images/Properties3-2.gif"></p>
  
<p>&quot;Text&quot; is a Property of Form1. Don't be confused by 
  the word &quot;Form1&quot; next to the word &quot;Text&quot;. All this means 
  is that the current value of the Text property is set to the word &quot;Form1&quot;. 
  This is the default.</p>
<p>To change this to something of your own, do this:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
   Click inside the area next to &quot;Text&quot;, and 
      delete the word &quot;Form1&quot; by hitting the backspace key on your keyboard
  </li>
  <li> 
    When &quot;Form1&quot; has been deleted, type the 
      words &quot;My First Form&quot;
  </li>
</ul>

  
<p align="center"><img src="images/TextProperty2-2.gif"></p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    Click back on the form itself (the one with the labels 
      and textboxes), or hit the return key on your keyboard
  </li>
  <li> 
    The words &quot;My First Form&quot; will appear as 
      white text on a blue background at the top of the form
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>When you've correctly changed the Text property, your Form will then look 
    like this one:</p>
  
<p align="center"><img src="images/TextPropertyForm-2.gif"></p>
  <p>As you can see, your new text has gone at the top of the form, 
    in white on the blue background. </p>
  <p>So the Text Property of a form is for setting the caption you want to display 
    in the title bar at the top.<br>
  </p>
  <p>In the next part, we'll take a look at how to change the text property of 
    labels and textboxes.</p>
