<H1 ID="Article">More about Variables in VB NET</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<P>We've met two variable types so far - <b>As String</b> and <b>As Integer</b>. 
  But there are quite a few more you can use. Let's start by examining number 
  variables.</P>
<p>Start a new project for this. If you have the old one displayed, you can click 
  <b>File &gt; Close Solution</b> from the menu bar. You will then be returned 
  to the Start Page. Click the N<b>ew Project</b> button at the bottom. In the 
  dialogue box, give your project a name.</p>
<p>Put a textbox and a Button on your new form. Change the Properties of the Textbox 
  to the following</p>
<p><b>Name</b>: txtNumbers<br>
  <b>Font</b>: MS Sans Serif, Bold, 10<br>
  <b>Text</b>: just delete the default Textbox1, and leave the textbox blank</p>
<p>Change the Properties of the Button to the following:</p>
<p><b>Text</b>: Answers<br>
  <b>Font</b>: MS Sans Serif, Bold, 10</p>
<p>Click on the Form itself, and change it's <b>Text</b> property to &quot;Testing 
  Types&quot;. Your Form should look something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/FormTypes.gif" width="308" height="227" alt="A Form to test Variable Types"></p>
<P>Double click on the Button to bring up the code window. Type the 
  following code for your Button (The <b>Button1_Click</b> part is spread over 
  three lines only for ease-of-reading on this web page. You can keep yours on 
  one line in your code):</p>
<p class="indent_small">Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender AsSystem.Object, _<br>
  ByVale As System.EventArgs) _<br>
  Handles Button1.Click</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim testNumber As Short</P>
<p class="text_indent_red">testNumber = Val( txtNumbers.Text )</p>
<P class="text_indent_red">MsgBox testNumber</p>
<p class="indent_small">End Sub</p>
<p>Notice that there is a new Type of variable declared - As Short. This means 
  &quot;Short Integer&quot;. We'll see what it does. The <b>Val</b> part converts 
  the Text into a number.</p>
<p>Run your programme. While it's running, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Enter the number 1 into the textbox, and click the Answers button </li>
  <li> The number 1 should display in the Message Box </li>
  <li> Add the number 2 to the textbox and click the Button </li>
  <li> The number 12 should display in the Message Box </li>
  <li> Add the number 3 to the textbox and click the Button </li>
  <li> The number 123 should display in the Message Box </li>
  <li> Keeping adding numbers one at a time, then clicking the button </li>
</ul>
<p> How many numbers did you get in the textbox before the following error message 
  was displayed? (Click Break to get rid of it.) 
<p align="center"><img src="images/errorInfinity.gif" alt="Overflow Error Message"> 
<P>You should have been able to enter <b>12345</b> quite safely. 
  When you entered <b>123456</b> and clicked the button, that's when the error 
  message displayed. 
<p>When you click the Break button, you are returned to the coding environment. 
  You'll see the problem line highlighted in yellow:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/OverflowError2.gif" alt="Problem lines are highlighted in yellow"></p>
<P>But your programme will still be running. So click <b>Debug &gt; 
  Stop Debugging</b> to return to the normal code window.</p>
<p>An Overflow happens when you try to put too much information into a variable 
  that can't handle it. </p>
<P>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason we got an error message after just 6 numbers was because of the 
  variable type. We had this:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim testNumber As Short</p>
<p>And it's As Short that is causing us the problems. If you use As Short you're 
  only allowed numbers up to a certain value. The range for a Short variable is 
  -32 768 to 32 767. When we entered 6 numbers, Visual Basic decided it didn't 
  want to know. If you run your programme again, and then enter 32768, you'll 
  get the same Overflow error message. If you change it once more to -32769, you'll 
  get the error message as well. So it's not just 6 numbers a Short Type can't 
  handle - it's 5 numbers above or below the values specified.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? Change the variable Type, of course!</p>
<p>Change the variable to this</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim testNumber As Integer</p>
<p>Now start the programme and try again, adding numbers one at a time to the 
  textbox, and then clicking the Command button. How far did you get this time?</p>
<p>If you started at 1 and added the numbers in sequence, you should have been 
  allowed to enter 1234567890. One more number and Visual Basic gave you the Overflow 
  error message, right? That's because variable types with As Integer also have 
  a limitation. The range you can use with the As Integer variable type is -2,147,483,648 
  to 2,147,483,647. If you want a really, really big number you can use As Long. 
</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim testNumber As Long</p>
<p>But these will get you whole numbers. Leave your number on As Integer. Run 
  your programme again and enter a value of 123.45 into your textbox. Press the 
  button and see what happens.</p>
<p>VB will chop off the point 45 bit at the end. If you want to work with floating 
  point numbers (the .45 bit), there are three Types you can use:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim testNumber As Single<br>
  Dim testNumber As Double<br>
  Dim testNumber As Decimal</p>
<p>Single and Double mean Single-Precision and Double-Precision numbers. If you 
  want to do scientific calculations, and you need to be really precise, then 
  use Double rather than Single: it's more accurate.</p>
<p>The <b>As Decimal</b> Type is useful when you want a precise number of decimal 
  places. It's not as accurate as the Double Type, though.</p>
<p>In terms of the space used in the computer's memory, Short Types use 2 Bytes, 
  Integer Types use 4 Bytes, Long Types use 8 Bytes, Single Types use 4 Bytes, 
  Double Types use 8 Bytes, and Decimal Types use 16 Bytes.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Write a programme to calculate the following sum.</p>
<p class="indent_big"> 0.123345678 * 1234</p>
<p>Use the Single Type first, then change it to <b>As Double</b>. Use a Message 
  box to display the answer. Was the number rounded up or rounded down for the 
  Single Type?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll get some more practise with variables.</p>
