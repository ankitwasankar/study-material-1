<H1 ID="Article">Using Variables in your VB NET Code</H1>
</HEADER> <SECTION> 
<p>In this next section, we're going to learn how to transfer the contents of 
  one textbox to another textbox. We'll also learn to transfer the text from a 
  label to a textbox, and whatever was in the textbox we'll transfer it to a label. 
  This will get us a little more practise with variables, and how to use them.</p>
<p>Ok, start a new Visual basic project. You should know how to do this by now, 
  and what the design environment looks like. But you should have a plain grey 
  Form on your screen. By default it will be called Form1.</p>
<p>Make sure the Form is selected (has it got the white squares around it?), and 
  the click the <b>Name</b> property in the Properties window. Change the Name 
  of the form to<b> frmVariables</b>. </p>
<p>Set the Text property of the Form to &quot;Transferring information&quot;. 
  You can choose any background colour you like for the form, or leave it on the 
  default.</p>
<p>Put the following controls on the Form, and change their properties to the 
  one's specified below (NOTE: <b>lbl</b> is short for label):</p>
<p><b>Textbox</b></p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"> <b>Name</b>: txtVariables<br>
  <b>Font</b>: MS Sans Serif, Bold, 10<br>
  <b>Text</b> Delete the default text &quot;Text1&quot; and leave it blank</p>
<p><b>Label</b></p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"> <b>Name</b>: lblTransfer <br>
  <b>BackColor</b>: A colour of your choice<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Label Caption<br>
  <b>Font</b>: MS Sans Serif, Bold, 10</p>
<p><b>Button</b></p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold"> <b>Name</b>: btnTransfer<br>
  <b>Text</b>: Transfer</p>
<p>The height of your controls is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>If you double click your Button to bring up the code window, you will see that 
  the first line of the code no longer says Button1_Click (etc). The first line 
  should say this</p>
<p class="indent_small_no_bold">Private Sub <b>btnTransfer_Click</b> (ByVal sender 
  As System.Object, _<br>
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _<br>
  Handles btnTransfer.Click</p>
<p  class="indent_small_no_bold">End Sub</p>
<p>The reason it has changed is because you changed the Name property of the Button. 
  The button now has the Name <b>btnTransfer</b>. If you wanted to, you could 
  change the Name property back to Button1. Then when you double clicked the button, 
  the code window would pop up and the first line would be Button1_Click(etc ).</p>
<p>What we're going to do now is to transfer the Text on the label (&quot;Label 
  Caption&quot;) to our empty textbox. And all with the click of a button.</p>
<p>As you'll see, there isn't much code. </p>
<p>Type the following into your code window:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim LabelContents As String</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">LabelContents = lblTransfer.Text</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">txtVariables.Text = LabelContents</p>
<p>Your code window should now look something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ButtonCode3-2.gif" border="1" alt="The Transfer code"></p>
<p>Now Run your programme and test it out. When you click on the &quot;Transfer&quot; 
  button, you should see that the contents of the label will be inserted into 
  the textbox:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/FormStrings5-2.gif" alt="VB Form shows what the transfer code does"></p>
<p>But let's break the code down and see what's going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="links_ads"><a href="../bookshop/net-2.html">No more reading 
  these lessons online - get the eBook here!</a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<dl> 
  <dt class="dt_red">Dim LabelContents As String</dt>
  <dd>Here is where we set up a variable called LabelContents. Because it will 
    be holding text, we've used the variable type As String.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt class="dt_red">LabelContents = lblTransfer.Text</dt>
  <dd>Here is where we put something into our empty variable. We changed the Name 
    property of our Label from the default Label1 to lblTransfer. A Label has 
    lots of properties you can manipulate. One of those properties is the Text 
    property. After you typed the word "lblTransfer" and then typed a full stop, 
    you probably saw a drop down box appear. Inside the box is a list of all the 
    properties and Methods that a Label has. We wanted to manipulate the Text 
    property of our label so we selected the word Text after the full stop. So 
    we were saying "Access the value of the Text property of the label called 
    lblTransfer, and put this value into the variable called LabelContents." Because 
    our Text was ""Label Caption", the variable LabelContents now holds the text 
    "Label Caption."</dd>
  <br>
  <dt class="dt_red">txtVariables.Text = LabelContents</dt>
  <dd>Finally, we want to transfer whatever is in the variable LabelContents to 
    the Textbox. Our Textbox is called txtVariables. Again, after typing the full 
    stop the drop down box would appear, showing you a list of all the properties 
    that a Textbox has. The one we're interested in is the Text Property. So we're 
    saying, "Take whatever text is in the variable LabelContents, and transfer 
    it to the Text property of the Textbox called txtVariables.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And with three lines of code we can transfer text from a label to a Textbox. 
  But can we do it the other way round? Can we transfer whatever is in a Textbox 
  to a Label? Well, sure we can.</p>
<p>Add another button to your form. Change its Name property from Button1 to cmdTransferToLabel, 
  and change the Caption property to &quot;Transfer To Label&quot;. Again, there's 
  just three lines of code.</p>
<p>So double click your new button to bring up the code window. Then type in the 
  following code:</p>
<p class="text_indent_red">Dim TextBoxContents As String</P>
<p class="text_indent_red">TextBoxContents = txtVariables.Text</P>
<p class="text_indent_red">lblTransfer.Text = TextBoxContents</p>
<p>Now, see if you can work out how it works. It's the same thing as the first 
  three lines of code: set up a variable, transfer the Text property of the Textbox 
  to the variable, transfer the variable to the Text property of the Label. Run 
  your programme and test it out. Type something into the Textbox, and then click 
  the &quot;Transfer To Label&quot; button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exercise E</h3>
<p>A button also has a Text Property. Write code to transfer the Text property 
  of a button to the Textbox. It's probably better for this exercise to create 
  a new Button. Set its Name property to whatever you like. And give its Text 
  Property a new value (The Text property will be Button1 by default) .</p>
<p>But the process is exactly the same as the two bits of code above - you should 
  only need 3 lines of code for this exercise.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a Variable</li>
  <li>Transfer the Text property of the button to the variable</li>
  <li>Transfer the variable to the Textbox</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next part, we'll start a Calculator project. This will get you some 
  more practical experience of working with variables.</p>
