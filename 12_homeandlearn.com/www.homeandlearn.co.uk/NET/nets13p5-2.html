<p>This lesson follows on from the previous two lessons: <a href="nets13p3-2.html">How 
  to create a second form</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The form with OK and Cancel buttons on it is not doing much good. We need it 
  do some work for us. Let's turn the form into a Change Case dialogue box.</p>
<p>Design a Form like the one in the following image (this is <b>frmSecond</b>):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2010/aForm_p307-2.gif"></p>
<p align="left">When you've designed your form, click back on Form1 and add a 
  Textbox to it. When the button on Form1 is clicked, the dialogue box above will 
  display. You can then select an option button to change the case to Upper, Lower 
  or Proper case. This will happen when the OK button is clicked. Whatever text 
  is in Texbox1 on Form1 will be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>Double click the OK button on <b>frmSecond</b> to access the code. You should 
  have the following:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Me.DialogResult = DialogResult.OK</b></p>
<p>If you want to refer to Texbox1 on Form1, you can't just do this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Form1.Textbox1.Text</b></p>
<p>In previous version of VB, that code would be all right. You're saying &quot;Access 
  the Text property of Textbox1 on Form1.&quot; The problem in VB.NET is that 
  forms are Classes. They don't become objects until one is created from a Class. 
  So the frmSecond Class knows nothing about Form1. It has no idea what it is.</p>
<p>The solution is to create a textbox object variable on Form1, and assign Textbox1 
  to this variable. But this variable has to be something that all Classes in 
  the project can see.</p>
<p>So add this near the top of your code window for Form1 (add it just below the 
  Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form line, or Public Class Form1):</p>
<p align="center"><b>Public Shared tb As TextBox</b></p>
<p>We're setting up a variable which we've called <b>tb</b>. A Textbox object 
  is going to be stored in this variable. But notice that the variable is <b>Public 
  Shared</b>. This way, <b>frmSecond</b> will be able to see the variable.</p>
<p>In the Form Load event for Form1, add the following line:</p>
<p align="center"><b>tb = Textbox1</b></p>
<p>When Form1 loads, the textbox called Textbox1 will be assigned to the tb variable. 
  Now Textbox1 can be seen by frmSecond.</p>
<p>Go back to your code for the OK button on frmSecond. Add the following two 
  lines at the top:</p>
  
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim ChangeCase As String<br>
  ChangeCase = Form1.tb.Text</p>
  
<p>We're setting up a String variable called ChangeCase. Whatever text is in Textbox1 
  of Form1 will then be assigned to the ChangeCase variable. But notice that as 
  soon as you type a full stop after Form1, the <b>tb</b> variable will be available 
  in the pop up list:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2010/aForm_p315-2.gif"></p>
<p>The Public variable called tb holds a reference to Textbox1 on Form1. When 
  you type a full stop after the tb, you get a list popping up. The list is all 
  the Properties and Methods that are available to Textbox1. One of these is the 
  Text property.</p>
<p>We now only need to add the code that does the actual converting. So add this 
  below the two lines you already have:</p>
  
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim ChangeCase As String<br>
  ChangeCase = Form1.tb.Text</p>
  
<p class="indent_small_blue">If optUpper.Checked Then</P>
  <P class="indent_big_blue">ChangeCase = ChangeCase.ToUpper</P>
  <P class="indent_small_blue">ElseIf optLower.Checked Then</P>
  <P class="indent_big_blue">ChangeCase = ChangeCase.ToLower</P>
  <P class="indent_small_blue">ElseIf optProper.Checked Then</P>
  <P class="indent_big_blue">ChangeCase = StrConv(ChangeCase, VbStrConv.ProperCase)</P>
  <P class="indent_small_blue">End If</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Form1.tb.Text = ChangeCase</p>
<p>The three options buttons on our form were called <b>optUpper</b>, <b>optLower</b> 
  and <b>optProper</b>. In the code, we're using an If Statement to see which 
  of these was selected. The one that was chosen will have its <b>Checked</b> 
  property set to <b>True</b>. We then store into the variable <b>ChangeCase</b> 
  the converted text from the textbox. The final line puts the converted text 
  back into Textbox1 on Form1. But you're coding window should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/vb_2010/aFormCode_p316-2.gif" border="1" alt="Change Case Code"></p>
<p>Note that the DialogResult.OK line is the final line of the code. When you're 
  writing your code, make sure that optUpper, optLower and optProper are changed 
  to whatever you called your Radio Buttons.</p>
<p>When you're finished adding the code, run your programme. Enter some text into 
  Textbox1. Then click the button that brings up the Change Case Dialogue box. 
  Select an option from the three available, and the click OK. The text in Textbox1 
  should be converted.</p>
<p>Setting and Getting value from one form to another can be quite a tricky process 
  at first. But once you get the hang of it you'll find it's not too difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that ends this section of this course. There's an awful lot more to learn 
  about Windows Forms, and a bit of experimentation is needed before you become 
  skilled in their use. But in a beginners course, you've learned enough to be 
  going on with.</p>
