<p><i>This lesson continues on from the previous part: <a href="nets9p7-2.html">Standard 
  Modules in VB .NET</a></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <a href="nets9p7-2.html">previous lesson</a>, we saw that we had some 
  problems with our code. VB placed a blue wiggly line under the name of our Sub:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/AddModuleSub-2.gif" alt="VB has a problem with the code" border="1"></p>
<P>What VB is saying is that it can't see your new Subroutine from 
  the inside of the button code. It thinks you haven't got a Sub called <b>AddNumbers</b>. 
  The reason it can't see it is we made the Sub <b>Private</b>. Only code inside 
  of the <b>modVerify</b> Module can see a Private Sub. If you want the Sub or 
  Function to be available to all the code in your project, including the button, 
  you have to make then Public. This involves nothing more than changing the word 
  <b>Private</b> to <b>Public</b>. Amend your Sub to this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/AddModuleSub2-2.gif" alt="Change Private to Public" border="1"></p>
<P>When you make the change from <b>Private</b> to <b>Public</b>, 
  the blue wiggly line should disappear from the Button code</p>
<p>Run your programme and test it out. Click your Button. You should get a message 
  box saying &quot;20&quot;.</p>
<p>We'll now add a Function to our new Module.</p>
<p>So bring up the code for your module. When you have your new Module displayed, 
  type in the following Function:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Public Function VerifyPostcode(ByVal postcode As String) As String</p>
  
<p class="indent_big_blue">postcode = StrConv(postcode, VbStrConv.UpperCase)</P>
  <P class="indent_big_blue">Return postcode</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">End Function</p>

<p>When you're finished, your coding window should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/AddModuleCode2-2.gif" alt="A Sub and a Function have been added to the Module" border="1"></p>
<P>&nbsp;</p>
<P class="links_ads"><a href="../bookshop/net-2.html">No more reading these lessons online - get the eBook here!</a></P>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<P>All the function does is to check a Postcode to see if the letters 
  in it are all in capitals. That's because, quite often, people will enter a 
  postcode as this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>ts1 4jh</b></p>
<p>What you want is a Postcode that reads:</p>
<p align="center"><b>TS1 4JH</b></p>
<p>The new function will convert a postcode handed to it, and make sure the letters 
  are all capitals.</p>
<p>The inbuilt function that does the converting is worth exploring. It's this:</p>
<p align="center"><b>StrConv( )</b></p>
<p>This is short for String Conversion. In between the round brackets, VB needs 
  you to put two things: the string you want to convert, and what sort of conversion 
  you want. As soon as you type a comma after the string you want to convert, 
  VB pops up a box of available conversion types:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/postcode-2.gif" alt="Conversion Types in VB NET"></p>
<P>A lot on the list are rather baffling. But the one we used was 
  the <b>UpperCase</b> one. Simple double click an item to add it to your code. 
  This gave us the following:</p>
<p align="center"><b>StrConv(</b> postcode<b>,</b> VbStrConv.UpperCase <b>)</b></p>
<p>The function will then convert all the letters in postcode to capitals.</p>
<p>Another useful one on the list is <b>ProperCase</b>. What this will do is take 
  a string and convert all the letters of the first word (or words) to capitals. 
  This is useful for addresses. So if somebody entered this as an address:</p>
<p align="center"><b>49 falkland street</b></p>
<p>The <b>VbStrConv.ProperCase</b> item would convert it to this:<br></p>
<p align="center"><b>49 Falkland Street</b></p>
<p>But back to our code.</p>
<p>Select your Form again. Then add a new Button, and a Textbox to it. Change 
  the Text property of the Textbox to <b>ts1 4jh</b>. Double click the button, 
  and add the following code for it:</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">Dim CheckPostcode As String<br>
  Dim ConvertPostcode As String</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">CheckPostcode = Trim(TextBox1.Text)</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">ConvertPostcode = VerifyPostcode(CheckPostcode)</p>
<p class="indent_small_blue">TextBox1.Text = ConvertPostcode</p>
<p>The first thing we do is get the Text from the textbox. This is passed to a 
  variable called CheckPostcode. The next line calls our new function. We hand 
  it the postcode we got from the textbox:</p>
<p align="center"><b>ConvertPostcode = VerifyPostcode( </b>CheckPostcode<b> )</b></p>
<p>When our function has finished the conversion, it will hand back (Return) the 
  result and put it in the variable ConvertPostcode. This is then placed back 
  inside the textbox.</p>
<p>Run your programme, and click the new button. You should find that the letters 
  in the postcode are converted to capitals.</p>
<p>The point about creating a Module to house all your Subs and Functions is that 
  they are in a separate file. You could write more Subs and Functions for your 
  Module, ones that validate text coming from a textbox (an email checker, for 
  example, or one that uses the ProperCase string conversion). You would then 
  have all this code in one file that you could add to totally different projects. 
  If the Subs and Functions were in the same code for the Form, you would have 
  to import the whole Form before you could use the very useful Subs and Functions 
  you created.</p>
<p>But that's enough about Modules. We'll move on to a new section.</p>
