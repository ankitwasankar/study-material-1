        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>In section 6, we're going to look at some slightly more complex formulas 
          than the simple operators. In fact the formulas in this section are 
          not really formulas at all. They are Functions. Don't be put off by 
          the name. A Function is just something to help you calculate. You've 
          already met the SUM() function. The ones in this section are just some 
          more of the functions built in to Excel. We will explore averages, date 
          and time formulas, and one or two financial formulas. It might get a 
          bit tricky, so hold on to your hats!</P>

        <h2>Averages</h2>
        <p>We'll make a start with averages. First, what is in an average? In 
          maths, an average is a number derived by dividing how many there are 
          in a list by the list total. For example, suppose a list of student 
          scores in an exam was this: 9, 7, 6, 7, 8, 4, 3, 9. We only have eight 
          scores. To get the average score we first need to get the total. So 
          add up the numbers in the list: 9 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 9 = 53. 
          Next divide by how many there are in the list: 8. So to get the average 
          score the sum is 53 divided by 8. The answer is 6.625. Which means that 
          the average score in the exam was 6.625.</p>
        <p>Once we have an average figure we can see at a glance which students 
          are performing above average, and which below. Clearly, the poor student 
          who scored only 3 needs some extra homework!</p>
        <p>So now that you know what an average is, how do you calculate averages 
          with Excel? Well, start a new spreadsheet and enter those exams scores 
          in cells A1 to A8. Your spreadsheet will look like the one below:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE1-2.JPG" width="219" height="171" alt="A list of Numbers for the Average Function"></p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Next, click in cell A9</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>We now need to insert the average Function</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p>There are a couple of ways to insert a function.</p>
        <p><b>Method 1</b></p>
        <p>Click on the equals sign next to the formula bar. This is the Edit 
          formula button, and can be seen in the picture below:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE2-2.JPG" width="284" height="206" alt="Click Edit Formula"></p>
        <p>When you click the equals button, you'll see a palette appear just 
          under the Name box and Formula bar. It will look like the one below:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE3-2.JPG" width="477" height="208" alt="the formula palette"></p>
        <p align="left">There are one or two things to notice about the Formula 
          palette. First look in cell A9. There is an equals sign in it. Excel 
          has entered this because all formulas and functions must start with 
          this symbol, and it knows that it's easy to forget to put an equals 
          sign in. So it does it for you.</p>
        <p>The next thing to notice is that the Name box says &quot;Sum&quot;. 
          There is a black down-pointing arrow to the right of &quot;Sum&quot;. 
          Clicking on the arrow will reveal a list of Functions.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE4-2.JPG" width="466" height="204" alt="A list of Functions"></p>
        <p align="left">The one we want is there. So click on <b>Average</b> with 
          your left mouse button. The palette changes to this rather complicated 
          one:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE5-2.JPG" width="476" height="203" alt="The Average Formula"></p>
        <p align="left">Excel does a few things here: shows you what Function 
          it is putting in the Formula bar at the top (=Average(A1:A8); gives 
          you a list of the values in your cells (in brackets after the Number1 
          text area); gives you the result (at the bottom &quot;Formula result 
          = &quot;).</p>
        <p>But don't worry if you're scratching your head over that dialogue box. 
          Just click the OK button at the bottom. The palette closes, and Excel 
          inserts the result of the average in cell A9.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Method 2</b></p>
        <p>The second way to enter a Function is this:</p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Click inside cell A9</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>From the menu bar at the top, click on <b>Insert</b></Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>From the drop down menu, click on <b>Function</b></Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>The following dialogue box appears:</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE6-2.JPG" width="382" height="290" alt="The Paste Function dialogue box"><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">This dialogue box is a listing of all the Functions built 
          in to Excel. The Average function is under Statistical.</p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> In the <b>Function category</b> section, click 
            on <b>Statistical</b> with your left mouse button</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>A list of all the Statistical functions appears 
            on the right hand side</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Locate <b>Average</b> and click it with your 
            left mouse button</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click the OK button at the bottom</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>The function palette appears, the same one from 
            Method 1</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click the OK button and Excel will insert the 
            answer to your Average Function in cell A9</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p>But what if Excel has the wrong cell references for your Average? Is 
          there any way you can edit the Functions? Yes, there is. Try this:</p>
        <p>Click in cell B9 of your spreadsheet. Use one of the methods outlined 
          to bring up the formula palette. Your spreadsheet will now look like 
          this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/AVERAGE7-2.JPG" width="466" height="197"></p>
        <p align="left">This time the formula bar just reads <b>=Average(A9)</b>. 
          You can edit the function by clicking inside the formula bar at the 
          top. Change A9 to A1:A8 and the click the OK button.</p>
        <p>Of course, you don't need to use the formula palette at all. You could 
          just enter the Function directly, just like you did with the Sum() function, 
          or any other formula: click on the cell where you want the answer to 
          appear. Then click inside the formula bar. Enter <b>=Average(A1:A9)</b> 
          and press the return key on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>The advantage of using the formula palette is that Excel enters the 
          correct function for you. It's very easy to make a typing error if you 
          do it yourself, and then get an enigmatic error message for your troubles.</p>
        <p>OK, time for an exercise.</p>

        <h2><b>Exercise</b><br>
        </h2>
        <p align="left">A dart's player is trying to work out his three dart average, 
          and his one dart average. Help him out. His scores for a single game 
          were these:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>60<br>
          55<br>
          24<br>
          95<br>
          100<br>
          60<br>
          86<br>
          21</b><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">So his score of 60 was achieved by throwing three darts. 
          Likewise, a total of 55 was achieved with three darts. In fact, every 
          score on the list is a the result of three darts. Your task is to work 
          out his three dart average.</p>
        <p>Once you have worked out his three dart average, let him know what 
          his average score was for one dart. (You don't need the Average Function 
          here. What you are working out is how many darts he threw in total. 
          Then divide the grand total for all his darts by this number. An easier 
          way to get the answer is to divide the Average by . . . ?)<br>
