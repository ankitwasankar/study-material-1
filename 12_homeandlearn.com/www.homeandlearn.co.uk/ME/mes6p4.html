        <h2>The PMT ( ) Function</h2>
        <p> If you want to know how much a loan will cost you, then the PMT ( 
          ) function is ideal. How much will I have to pay back if I borrow a 
          thousand pounds over 2 years? Over 5 years? Over 10 years? You can calculate 
          this with the PMT ( ) function.</p>
        <p>The PMT( ) function expects certain values in between those two brackets. 
          The values are known as arguments. The arguments that the PMT( ) function 
          expects are these:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>PMT(rate, nper, pv, </b>fv, type<b>)</b></p>
        <p>The last two, fv and type, are optional. If all this sounds very confusing, 
          then don't worry: we'll clear it up with an example.</p>
        <p>The example is this: You want to borrow ten thousand pounds from your 
          friendly banker. You also want to pay it back over 5 years. What you 
          need to know is - how much will this loan cost me every month?</p>
        <p>We'll work it out with the PMT( ) function. First, create a new spreadsheet 
          like the one below:</p>
        <p><img src="images/PMT1.JPG" width="642" height="103" alt="Create this spreadsheet"><br>
        </p>
        <p>The figure in cell B1 is the amount we want to borrow - ten thousand 
          pounds. Our financial function PMT( ) will go under Monthly Amount, 
          in cell D4.</p>
        <p>Before we can enter our function, we need to work out the Interest 
          Rate, the Number of Payments, and the Present value. These are the arguments 
          for our function. Let's start with the Interest Rate, the first of our 
          arguments (<b>rate</b>).</p>
        <p>The bank tells us that the interest rate is 12 percent. This is for 
          the entire year. As we want to know how much to pay back each month, 
          we need to divide this figure by 12 (12 months in a year; divide this 
          into 12 percent). Of course, this is a simple division: 12 divided by 
          12 is 1. But we'll let Excel work it out. So do the following:<br>
        </p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Click inside cell A4</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click inside the formula bar</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Enter the following formula:</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p align="center"> <b>= 12% / 12</b></p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> The press the return key on your keyboard</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Excel will enter 0.01 in cell A4</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p>The next thing we need to work out is how many payments there are in 
          total. We are paying back the loan every month for 5 years. As there 
          are 12 months in a year, the formula is just 12 multiplied by 5. So 
          do this:<br>
        </p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Click inside cell B4</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click inside the formula bar</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Enter the following formula:</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p align="center"> <b>= 12 * 5</b></p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Press the Return key on your keyboard</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Excel will enter 60 in cell B4</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p>OK, we have now worked out the second argument for our PMT( ) function 
          - the <b>nper</b> bit. We can now move on to the <b>pv</b> part of the 
          argument, or Present Value. The Present Value is sometimes known as 
          the Principal. It is what the loan is worth now, and not say 5 years 
          into the future. In other words, it's ten thousand pounds for us. So 
          for the Present Value column in your spreadsheet, do this:<br>
        </p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Click inside cell C4</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click inside the formula bar</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Enter this:</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p align="center"> <b>= B1</b></p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Press the return key on your keyboard</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Excel will enter 10000 in cell C4, because this 
            is the figure you entered into cell B1<br>
          </Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin>Your spreadsheet should now look like the one below: 
        <p><img src="images/PMT2.JPG" width="643" height="119" alt="What your spreadsheet should look like"></p>
        <p>Time now to enter our PMT( ) function in cell D4. So, do the following:</p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Click inside cell D4</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click inside the formula bar</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Enter the following function:</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p align="center"> <b>=PMT(A4, B4, C4)</b></p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Press the return key on your keyboard</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Excel should now have entered the monthly payments in cell D4. It is 
          usually in red, and with a minus sign at the start (minus because it's 
          what you owe to the bank). The answer you should have in D4 is -&pound;222.44.</p>
        <p>So we have to pay back to the bank every month two hundred and twenty 
          two pounds forty four pence. </p>
        <p>The final column is &quot;Total Paid Back&quot;. To work out that answer 
          you need to multiply the monthly payments by the number of payments. 
          Which should cause you no problems at all. When you're done, the final 
          spreadsheet looks like this:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/PMT3.JPG" width="640" height="120" border="1"></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Varying the Interest Rate</h3>
        <p>We'll now change that spreadsheet slightly. What we'll do is vary the 
          number of payments. At the moment, we're saying 12 * 5 for the number 
          of payments. But what if we decide we want to pay it back over ten years? 
          How much are the monthly payments then? And how much do we pay back 
          in total?</p>
        <p>We also want to vary that interest rate. There is plenty of competition 
          for loans. What if we can get a better deal for our interest payments? 
          How does it effect the monthly payments if the interest rate is 11 percent? 
        </p>
        <p>We can make only a few slight changes to the spreadsheet to answer 
          these questions.</p>
        <p>Insert two more rows into your spreadsheet, and add two labels. Your 
          spreadsheet sheet match the one below:<br>
        </p>
        <img src="images/PMT4.JPG" width="645" height="102"> 
        <p>To get the interest rate, we entered a formula. We entered this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= 12 % / 12</b></p>
        <p>If we put the percentage figure in a cell of its own, we could then 
          reference that cell in our formula. We could just put this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= B3 / 12</b></p>
        <p>Then we could vary the interest rate by changing the number in cell 
          B3. To clear any confusion, do the following:<br>
        </p>
      </Div>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin> Click inside cell B3</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click inside the formula bar</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Type in <b>= 12 %</b></Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Press the Return key on your keyboard</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click back inside cell <b>B3</b> because we 
            need to format the cell as a percentage</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>To format the cell as a percentage, click <b>Format</b> 
            from the menu bar</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>From the drop down menu, click on <b>Cells</b>. 
            The Format Cells dialogue box appears</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Select the <b>Number</b> tab strip</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Under <b>Category</b>, click on <b>Percentage</b>. 
          </Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Click the OK button when you are done</Div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <DIV Class = leftMargin>Cell B3 should now read 12.00 %</Div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <DIV Class = leftMargin> 
        <p>You can now change the formula for your interest rate. So click inside 
          the cell where you interest rate is, probably cell A6. Click inside 
          the formula bar. Change the formula from this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= 12 % / 12</b></p>
        <p>to this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= B3 / 12</b></p>
        <p>When you press the Return key on your keyboard, all of your monthly 
          payment terms should stay the same. The difference is that you can now 
          alter the interest rate from cell B3. Test it out. Change the interest 
          to 10 percent and see what happens to your Monthly Amount figure.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>The Number of Payments formula currently reads = 12 * 5. Change this 
          formula so that number of years is coming from cell B2.</p>
        <p>When you're finished, you final spreadsheet will look like this one:<br>
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/PMT5.JPG" width="646" height="136"></p>
        <p>Play about with the figures in cells B1 to B3 and watch the D6 and 
          E6 figures change. What about a ten year loan with interest of 15 percent?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>PMT extra</h2>
        <p>You can use the PMT( ) function to work out your savings. You might 
          want to know how much you'll have to put away in the bank if you want 
          to save 2 thousand pounds in one year. Remember the full PMT( ) function? 
          It was this:</p>
        <p align="center"><b>PMT(rate, nper, pv, fv, type)</b></p>
        <p>To work out how much you'll have to save each month, you need that 
          <b>fv</b> part. The <b>fv</b> stands for Future Value. You would then 
          use the function like this (assume that the interest rate is a massive 
          10 percent):</p>
        <p align="center"><b>= PMT(10% / 12, 12 * 1, 0, 2000)</b></p>
        <p>The zero is for the <b>pv</b> part. The <b>pv</b> was Present Value. 
          Because you haven't saved anything yet, the present value of your savings 
          is zero. The 2000 is how much you want to save over 1 year</p>
