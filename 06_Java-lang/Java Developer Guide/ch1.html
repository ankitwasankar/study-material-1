<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>In its brief existence, the </FONT>World Wide
Web has evolved into a truly global information space. Not only
does it offer information on any subject, it provides its citizens
with the power to globally publish information on any subject
and at minimal cost. The massive international participation in
the Web has resulted in the creation of many Web pages that are
not only informative, but also entertaining. This entertainment
value has further fueled the Web's growth and has led to browsing
becoming an international pastime.
<P>
Browsing involves scanning Web pages for interesting information,
following useful links to other pages, and repeating the process
until we come across something that makes us temporarily stop
and focus. Sometimes we mutter, &quot;Hmm&quot; or &quot;That's
interesting!&quot; and create a bookmark. Then, eventually, we
move on.
<P>
The tendency to move on and continue browsing is natural. We usually
don't read the same book over and over. If we have a stack of
magazines in front of us, we're likely to flip through them all.
Web pages are like magazine pages, except that they are more available,
usually free, and have more &quot;next&quot; pages to which to
turn.
<P>
Computer programs are different. They are active, while books,
magazines, and Web pages are static or passive. People do use
programs over and over. I still use WordPerfect 5.1. Some people
still use CP/M. I have a friend who played DOOM several hours
a day for months.
<P>
This difference between active computer programs and passive Web
pages is what makes Java an attractive addition to the Web. When
we click on a Web page containing a Java applet, we don't just
read it, listen to it, or watch it-we <I>interact</I> with it.
Interactivity is the difference between a program and a page,
and Java has brought dynamic, interactive content to the Web.
<P>
Java's rapidly growing popularity is due to the Web. But Java's
inherent power does not come from the fact that it is a Web programming
language. The talented software engineers at Sun, in bringing
Java to the Web, have elegantly solved a much broader and more
significant problem-how to develop network-capable windowing software
that will run on almost any 32-bit computer and operating system.
<P>
The modern software developer faces enormous headaches and challenges
when he tries to develop software that is portable to Microsoft
Windows, X Window systems, Motif, MacOS, and OS/2 windowing and
networking environments. The usual approach is to pick a target
operating system (OS), write software for that OS, and eventually
migrate it to the other OS platforms. This usually involves great
expense in terms of labor and software development resources.
<P>
Java fulfills the software developer's dream of being able to
write software in a single language that will support windowing
and networking on all major OS platforms, without specialized
tailoring <I>or even recompilation</I>. But Java's attractiveness
does not end here. Sun's engineers were thoughtful enough to develop
in Java a language and runtime system that are simple, compact,
object-oriented, extendible, and secure. And then they gave it
away for free!
<P>
The objective of this book is to provide an introduction to using
the gift of Java in its broader context-as a platform-independent
software development language. Java's capabilities to provide
interactive content to Web pages, in the form of applets, are
covered within this broader context, but these capabilities do
not limit the focus of the book's presentation.
<H2><A NAME="WhatIsJava"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>What Is
Java?</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
Forrest Gump might say that Java is as Java does. Java is a programming
language, a runtime system, a set of development tools, and an
application programming interface (API). The relationships between
these elements are depicted in <A HREF="f1-1.gif" >Figure 1.1</A>.
<P>
<IMG SRC="f1-1.gif"><B>Figure 1.1 : </B><I>Java unveiled.</I></A>
<P>
As illustrated in <IMG SRC="f1-1.gif" >Figure 1.1</A>, a software
developer writes programs in the Java language that use predefined
software packages of the Java API. The developer compiles his
or her programs using the Java compiler. This results in what
is known as <I>compiled bytecode</I>. Bytecode is in a form that
can be executed on the Java virtual machine, the core of the Java
runtime system. You can think of the virtual machine as a microprocessor
that is implemented in software and runs using the capabilities
provided by your operating system and computer hardware. Since
the Java virtual machine is not a real microprocessor, the Java
bytecode is interpreted, rather than executed directly in the
native machine instructions of the host computer. (There are plans
to make it possible to translate Java bytecode into machine code
on-the-fly.) The Java runtime system consists of the virtual machine
plus additional software, such as dynamic link libraries, that
are needed to implement the Java API on your operating system
and hardware.
<P>
The Java API contains predefined software packages with numerous
platform-independent &quot;hooks&quot; into the native windowing
and networking capabilities of the host operating system. The
Java API provides a single common API across all operating systems
to which Java is ported.
<P>
The keys to Java's portability are its runtime system and its
API. The runtime system is very compact, evolving from earlier
Sun efforts to build a software platform for consumer electronics.
This platform was not designed around any existing microprocessor;
it was built from scratch to be simple and efficient. The fact
that it was not tied to a given hardware architecture enabled
it to be architecture neutral. The simple, efficient, compact,
and architecture-neutral nature of the runtime system allows it
to be highly portable and still provide effective performance.
<P>
The powerful windowing and networking features included in the
Java API make it easier for programmers to develop software that
is both attractive and platform independent. For example, Ada
is a programming language that is highly standardized and supported
on most operating systems. Yet Ada applications are not very portable.
This is because Ada does not come with a common API that supports
windowing and networking on all platforms. Java differs from Ada
and all other programming languages in that there is one universal,
but powerful, Java API for all operating system platforms. That
is why Java is the most portable language.
<H2><A NAME="TheOriginsofJava"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>The
Origins of Java</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
At this point, you may wonder how Sun's engineers were able to
develop such a powerful software development environment and surpass
all known programming languages. The answer is they didn't-at
least not directly. Java evolved from other research projects
at Sun.
<P>
The development of Java wasn't as accidental or monumental as
the discovery of penicillin, but it shares some of its characteristics.
The origins of Java trace back to 1991, when Sun was investigating
consumer electronics products. At this time, Mosaic and the World
Wide Web were just interesting concepts.
<P>
James Gosling, the father of Java, was intent on building a low-cost,
hardware-independent software platform using C++. For a number
of technical reasons, C++ was dropped, and a new language, called
Oak, was developed, based on C++, but eliminating its shortcomings.
These shortcomings include problems associated with multiple inheritance,
automatic type conversion, the use of pointers, and memory management.
<P>
Oak was used to develop a small electronics device called *7.
This project resulted in the precursors of many of the components
of Java: the development environment, runtime system, and API.
The technology was explored in a number of consumer applications
but was a little ahead of its time.
<P>
By 1994 the Web emerged, Oak was renamed Java, and the proverbial
light bulb went on in the minds of the Java developers. Java was
used as the basis for a Web browser, called WebRunner. WebRunner
was successfully demonstrated, and the Java/HotJava project took
off.
<P>
HotJava, Java, and the Java documentation and source code were
made available over the Web, as an alpha version, in early 1995.
Initially Java was hosted on SPARC Solaris, and then on Windows
NT. In the summer of 1995, Java was ported to Windows 95 and Linux.
In the fall of 1995 the Java Beta 1 version was released through
Sun's Web site, and Java support was introduced in the Netscape
2.0 browser.
<P>
The Java Beta 1 release led scores of vendors to license Java
technology, and Java porting efforts were initiated for all major
operating systems.
<P>
In December 1995 the Java Beta 2 version was released, and JavaScript
was announced by Sun and Netscape. Java's success became inevitable
when, in early December, both Microsoft and IBM announced their
intention to license Java technology.
<P>
On January 23, 1996, Java 1.0 was officially released and made
available for download over the Internet. JavaScript was also
released. Netscape 2.0 now provides support for both Java and
JavaScript.
<H2><A NAME="WhyPrograminJava"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Why
Program in Java?</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
So far we have touched on only two reasons to program in Java-it
is platform independent and it supports interactive content on
Web pages. Does this mean that Java is for everybody? Certainly
not!
<P>
If you are developing highly complex, performance-critical number
crunching algorithms for a Cray computer, then Java is probably
not the language for you. Try FORTRAN. If you are developing patches
to legacy code from the 1970s, you might use COBOL. If you are
developing software for the U.S. Department of Defense, you should
probably use Ada.
<P>
So, for what types of software applications is Java well suited?
The answer is almost everything else. <IMG SRC="f1-2.gif" >Figure 1.2</A>
summarizes the types of applications at which Java excels.
<P>
<IMG SRC="f1-2.gif"><B>Figure 1.2 : </B><I>Where Java excels.</I></A>
<P>
Because of its intended use on the Web, where even the smallest
security vulnerability could potentially be exploited and cause
global mayhem, Java was designed with multiple layers of security
countermeasures embedded in the compiler, runtime system, and
in browsers that support Java, known as Java-enabled browsers.
These countermeasures make Java inherently more secure for developing
any type of trusted application software. <A HREF="ch39.html" >Chapter 39</A>,
&quot;Java Security,&quot; is devoted to Java security.
<P>
Java is exceptionally well suited to distributed networking applications
because of its built-in networking support and the runtime system's
capability to dynamically load Java bytecode across the network.
Java also provides the capability to dynamically utilize new content
and protocol handling software. The HotJava browser, written in
Java, is an excellent example of Java's distributed networking
capabilities.
<P>
Java is a sound choice for developing software where reliability
is of utmost concern, such as mission-critical applications. Java's
object-oriented nature combined with numerous, compile-time and
runtime integrity checks eliminate many difficult-to-find programming
errors. The Java language has removed many of the dangerous programming
capabilities, such as modifiable pointers, unchecked type conversion,
and relaxed bounds checking, that are commonly found in other
programming languages, such as C and C++.
<P>
The Java API provides full support of multithreaded programming.
Multithreaded programs can be developed in a single, consistent
manner, independent of the vagaries of the host operating system
interface.
<P>
Java classes and objects directly support the object-oriented
concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, messages and methods,
and data hiding. Java interfaces provide support for multiple
inheritance and polymorphism. The Java language retains all the
benefits of object-oriented programming without the performance
impacts associated with pure object languages, such as Smalltalk.
<P>
The Java API provides extensive support of windowing and graphical
user interface development without the complexities associated
with maintaining multiple window class libraries. Several visual
programming tools have been developed for Java.
<H2><A NAME="JavaandHotJava"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Java
and HotJava</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
My first experience with Java was through an early version of
HotJava. Java and HotJava are sometimes confused. Java is the
language, development and runtime environments, and API. HotJava
is a Web browser that is written in Java. HotJava highlights many
of the Java features mentioned in the previous section.
<P>
HotJava is a Java-enabled browser. This means that HotJava can
execute Java applets contained on Web pages. In order to accomplish
this, HotJava calls the Java runtime system. The Netscape 2.0
browser, like HotJava, is also Java enabled. It contains a copy
of the Java runtime system embedded within it. <IMG SRC="f1-3.gif" >Figure 1.3</A>
illustrates the operation of HotJava and other Java-enabled browsers.
<P>
<IMG SRC="f1-3.gif"><B>Figure 1.3 : </B><I>How HotJava and Netscape 2.0 support Java applets.</I></A>
<P>
Both HotJava and Netscape request Web pages, written in HTML,
from Web servers on the Internet. Since HotJava is written in
Java, it uses the Java API and runtime system to display the Web
pages to a user. Netscape, on the other hand, is written in C++
and uses C++ functions to display HTML documents.
<P>
When either browser encounters an APPLET tag in an HTML file,
it requests the Java bytecode file necessary to execute the applet
from the Web server. HotJava loads and executes the bytecode file
using the Java runtime system. Netscape executes the bytecode
file using an embedded version of the Java runtime system.
