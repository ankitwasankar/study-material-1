In this chapter you will learn what an applet is, how it relates
to HTML, and what some of the possible uses of applet technology
are. By the time you finish this chapter, you will have an understanding
of what an applet is, how it works, and what it can do.
<H2><A NAME="HowAppletsWork"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>How Applets
Work</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000> </FONT></H2>
<P>
Applet technology is the driving force behind the intensity of
the Java revolution. Applets enhance Web documents with animation,
sound, and other special effects. However, applets are just standard
Java programs with a few special hooks into the Web browser's
environment. The capability of applets to take advantage of the
resources provided by a Web browser's environment is what allows
them to be easily and powerfully integrated within Web pages.
<P>
<IMG SRC="f31-1.gif" >Figure 31.1</A> describes the steps an applet
takes to display itself in the browser's window.
<P>
<IMG SRC="f31-1.gif"><B>Figure 31.1 : </B><I>How a Java applet works.</I></A>
<P>
As the figure shows, the browser makes a request to the loader
to fetch the applet specified in the document's HTML. After the
applet has been fetched, the applet begins to execute. The applet
is executed by the Java runtime interpreter attached to the browser.
The browser acts as a conduit between the Java Virtual Machine
inside the interpreter and the outside user interface.
<P>
The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Applet</FONT></TT> class provides
an application framework and tools to access the facilities provided
by the browser. Via the browser, the applet has access to graphics,
sound, and network capabilities. The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Applet</FONT></TT>
class can be viewed as merely a wrapper around the capabilities
provided by the browser.
<H3><A NAME="TheRelationshipBetweenHTMLandApplet">The Relationship
Between HTML and Applets</A></H3>
<P>
An applet is like a child application of the browser. The browser
launches the applet in a predefined environment inside the browser.
In turn, the browser obtains the information pertaining to the
applet's environment from the current document's HTML. In this
sense, the relationship between HTML and an applet is that of
a command line executing a program.
<P>
From within HTML, the syntax to specify the execution of an applet
is provided by the applet and parameter tags as discussed in <A HREF="ch16.html" >Chapter 16</A>,
&quot;Web Programming with the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">java.applet</FONT></TT>
Package.&quot;
<P>
The <I>applet tag</I> provides all the information needed to launch
the applet. Everything from the base directory to command-line
parameters can be specified from within this tag. Here's an example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">&lt;APPLET CODE = &quot;lights.class&quot;
width=400 height=75 align=center &gt;<BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;text&quot; VALUE=&quot;Blink&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;<BR>
&lt;HR&gt;<BR>
If you were using a Java(tm)-enabled browser,<BR>
you would see blinking lights instead of this paragraph.<BR>
&lt;HR&gt;<BR>
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;<BR>
&lt;/APPLET&gt;</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
From this HTML command line, the browser is told how to launch
the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">lights.class</FONT></TT> file with
the parameter <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">text</FONT></TT>. The HTML
merely specifies a command line of sorts to the browser.
<H3><A NAME="AppletsandInteractiveWebPages">Applets and Interactive
Web Pages</A></H3>
<P>
Usually, when the word <I>applet </I>is mentioned, the World Wide
Web is not far out of mind. There is good reason for this. An
applet is a Java program designed to run in the environment provided
by a Web browser. The last statement might seem a little simplistic,
but take a second to think what that environment provides to an
application.
<P>
Inside the browser, an application has the capability to display
images, play audio files, and access the Internet. The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Applet</FONT></TT>
class provides methods to tap these resources provided by the
Web browser.
<P>
Because applets are executed locally on your machine, you are
able to interact with the applet as part of the Web page's display.
Other Web applications that rely on CGI programs (<A HREF="ch32.html" >see Chapter 32</A>,
&quot;Integrating Applets into Distributed Applications&quot;)
do not provide interactivity at the local level. Instead, your
browser must send information-processing requests to programs
that are located on remote Web servers. Besides performance impacts,
this remote processing approach also suffers from the difficulties
involved in maintaining information about the state of the applications
it supports. The Java model of local execution is able to support
a high degree of interactivity. All state information is maintained
within the local browser environment and is not distributed between
the browser and Web server.
<H3><A NAME="AppletsVersusScripts">Applets Versus Scripts</A>
</H3>
<P>
As discussed previously, applets are launched from within an HTML
command. After an applet is launched, it operates in a well-defined
area of the browser window and is restricted from altering the
state or content of the current HTML document. Scripts written
in the JavaScript language are not placed under these restrictions
and have more latitude in modifying the state of the HTML document
being displayed.
<P>
An applet is treated as a self-contained object by a Web browser
and is handled in much the same way as an inline image. On the
other hand, scripts are integrated within the document's HTML.
Because the browser executes the script and not the Java runtime
interpreter, it has the capability to modify the contents of the
entire browser window, a task that an applet cannot perform.
<P>
Applets and scripts each serve a different purpose. Scripts provide
the capability to dynamically alter the content of an HTML document,
whereas applets are separate, interactive applications that execute
within the context of the browser and display information in a
limited area of the browser window.
<H3><A NAME="TheExecutionofanApplet">The Execution of an Applet</A>
</H3>
<P>
When the browser comes across the applet tag, it begins gathering
the information needed to launch the applet. After the HTML document
has been completely interpreted and displayed, the Java runtime
interpreter is requested to execute the applet.
<P>
When the interpreter receives the request to execute the applet,
it executes a loader mechanism to fetch the binary file. After
the file is successfully transferred onto the local machine, it
undergoes a number of tests to verify its security and stability.
<A HREF="ch39.html" >Chapter 39</A>, &quot;Java Security,&quot;
covers applet security. If all is well, the interpreter begins
execution of the applet.
<P>
Execution continues until the applet terminates or the current
browser document is dismissed. This can occur in a couple of different
ways: The user might jump to another URL or the browser might
terminate. In either case, the applet is terminated.
<H3><A NAME="UsingWindowComponents">Using Window Components</A>
</H3>
<P>
<B> </B>Window components can be added to the applet to create
a friendly user interface. Java provides a number of window components,
which can be found in the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">java.awt</FONT></TT>
library.
<P>
All of the window components added to an applet are confined to
the applet window area in the current browser document. The applet
window contains the entire paintable region; anything that does
not fit inside that region is clipped.
<P>
Using the provided window components, applets have the capability
to contain the same look and feel of other window application
programs. Applets can use all GUI components that can be used
by <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Panel</FONT></TT> objects. In addition,
applets have access to many of the capabilities provided by the
browser.
<H3><A NAME="AddingContentandProtocolHandlersto">Adding Content
and Protocol Handlers to Applets</A></H3>
<P>
Java supplies a set of interfaces that support the development
of content and protocol handlers. <A HREF="ch28.html" >Chapters 28</A>,
&quot;Content Handlers,&quot; and <A HREF="ch29.html" >29</A>,
&quot;Protocol Handlers,&quot; cover the use of these interfaces.
Content and protocol handlers may be added to applets to provide
the capability to retrieve and display different types of Web
objects or to use services provided by new or custom Internet
protocols. By using these content and protocol handlers, Java
applications become more capable network clients and can be used
to support distributed processing applications, as discussed in
<A HREF="ch32.html" >Chapter 32</A>.
<H2><A NAME="UsingAppletsasInlineViewers"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Using
Applets as Inline Viewers</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>
</FONT></H2>
<P>
Applets have the capability to present images, sounds, and other
multimedia objects inside an HTML document. Scripts provide the
means to dynamically change the content of an HTML document. The
combination of the two produces very powerful results, including
the capability to use applets as inline viewers.
<P>
The interactive Web catalog is a perfect example of the inline
viewer concept. A Web page contains a script-enabled order form
that contains a selection field. The user uses this selection
field to select the product to order. When this happens, the script
launches an applet to give a visual presentation of the item selected,
providing the user with more information with which to make a
purchase decision.
<P>
Using an applet as an inline viewer allows for more flexibility
than standard HTML facilities. The content to be viewed might
contain contextual interactive information rather than being a
flat piece of media.
<H2><A NAME="UsingAppletsasNetworkClients"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Using
Applets as Network Clients</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>
</FONT></H2>
<P>
The concept of containing a network client inside an HTML document
might seem a little strange to you, and for good reason-embedding
a client inside a client seems redundant. However, the browser
client can be viewed as a delivery mechanism for the embedded
client, allowing Web-based support of other application protocols.
<P>
By combining applets with protocol handlers, an applet can quickly
become a Telnet, an FTP, or even an embedded HTTP client. If a
custom protocol handler is used, the applet can become the means
for users to access custom network applications.
<H2><A NAME="OptimizingApplets"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Optimizing
Applets </FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Like most applications on the Internet, applets are constrained
by their user's communication bandwidth capabilities. You know
it is a good idea to optimize Web pages for optimal low-bandwidth
performance; the same holds true for applets.
<P>
Fortunately, graphics usually constitute a much greater physical
size than the applet's executable size. I say &quot;fortunately&quot;
because it is far easier to optimize the loading of media than
to worry about code generation.
<P>
Applets, being a mechanism for a graphical user interface, usually
require the transfer of graphics files. This process can take
varying amounts of time depending on the speed of the connection.
Taking the approach of loading media in the background, while
the user is busy doing something else, limits the annoying delays
associated with media transfers.
<P>
Hopefully, low bandwidth will not always be a problem for Internet
applications. However, for as long as users have to wait for something
to display on their screen, optimizing applications for low-bandwidth
situations will produce applications that are more likely to satisfy
user expectations.

from Online Examples</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000> </FONT>
</H2>
<P>
As technologies advance, the early adopter usually provides examples
to promote the technology. So is the case with scripts and applets.
A number of companies have jumped on the Java wagon from the get-go
and provide examples of their endeavors. The following are a few
sites where valuable information can be found:

This chapter gives background information on how applets work
and how they relate to scripts written in the JavaScript language.
You have also been given a little taste of what applets and scripts
can achieve. <A HREF="ch32.html" >Chapter 32</A> discusses how
applets can be integrated into distributed processing applications.
This chapter is designed to get your proverbial wheels turning.
