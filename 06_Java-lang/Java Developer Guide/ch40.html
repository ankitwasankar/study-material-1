<P>
This chapter takes a look at some of the emerging technologies
in the Java world. The primary purpose of the chapter is to give
you more insight into what is out there and how to find out more.
After you have finished this chapter, you will have a greater
awareness of developments in the Java world.
<H2><A NAME="JavaEnabledBrowsers"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Java-Enabled
Browsers</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
In the current Web browser arena there are a number of different
Java-enabled choices. Although some may provide more features
than others, this chapter covers only the browser's Java capability.
Use this information only as a reference, and contact your vendor
for any specific questions.
<H3><A NAME="HotJava">HotJava</A></H3>
<P>
HotJava is a Web browser coded in Java by Sun. It uses a modular
approach to handling different MIME types and application protocols.
HotJava is currently available on Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh
Powerpc, and UNIX platforms.
<P>
For more information, contact <TT><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/HotJava/index.htmll">http://java.sun.com/HotJava/index.htmll</A></TT>.
<H3><A NAME="NetscapeNavigator">Netscape Navigator</A></H3>
<P>
Netscape currently has the largest market share of browsers in
use. Conservative estimates show Netscape holding 70% of the market.
Netscape's products are currently offered on a number of different
platforms.
<P>
Netscape Navigator initially began incorporating Java as a browser
plug-in. It is now an integral part of the browser that is shipped
with release 2.0 and later. Netscape also adopted the JavaScript
language into releases later than 2.0.
<P>
For more information, contact <TT><A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</A></TT>.
<H3><A NAME="OraclePowerBrowser">Oracle PowerBrowser</A></H3>
<P>
The Oracle PowerBrowser provides a number of features such as
an integrated Web server, authoring tools, and Java applet support.
It also contains a few features that provide database access support.
The current platforms supported are Windows, Windows 95, and Windows
NT. PowerBrowser also contains its own scripting language, Oracle
BASIC.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="BorlandsLatte"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Borland's
Latte</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The need for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will
become apparent as the Java technology grows. Borland's first
attempt at a native Java IDE is Latte.
<P>
Latte has begun to be integrated into the Borland C++ compiler
utilities, very much like Symantec Espresso. The final product
will be completely independent from Borland C++.
<P>
For more information, contact <TT><A HREF="http://www.borland.com/Product/java/qanda.htmll#latte">http://www.borland.com/Product/java/qanda.htmll#latte</A></TT>.
<H3><A NAME="VisualDesign">Visual Design</A></H3>
<P>
Latte provides the capability to visually represent the Java class
hierarchy. Presumably, Latte will eventually provide a Java resource
builder.
<H3><A NAME="TheIntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment">The Integrated
Development Environment </A></H3>
<P>
The Integrated Development Environment provides the developer
with ready access to an editor, a compiler, a debugger, and more.
Latte will provide an IDE for Java development.
<H3><A NAME="PerformanceImprovements">Performance Improvements</A>
</H3>
<P>
Latte's compiler claims to be faster and cleaner than Sun's <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">javac</FONT></TT>
compiler. That fact still remains to be proven. However, judging
by the speed of the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">javac</FONT></TT>
compiler, any performance increase would be greatly appreciated.
<H2><A NAME="SymantecsCafÈ"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Symantec's
Caf&eacute;</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Symantec's version of the Java IDE began by integrating with the
preexisting Symantec C++ IDE, called Symantec Espresso. Eventually,
the product became completely disjointed from the C++ library
and changed its name to Caf&eacute;.
<P>
Caf&eacute; claimed to do everything that Latte promised; however,
Symantec delivered on its promises faster than Borland. As a result,
Caf&eacute; hit the market before Latte, delivering a native Java
code IDE and compiler that is a bit faster than <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">javac</FONT></TT>.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="DatabaseExtensions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Database
Extensions</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Probably the most powerful Java database solution is Sun's JDBC
(Java database connectivity). The JDBC is based on the X/Open
SQL call-level interface (CLI), which is the same model used to
design ODBC.
<P>
Via a class interface, Java applications can access database information
through a SQL interface. By using an ODBC-type mechanism, the
programmer will not have to worry about database-specific issues.
Several companies have endorsed the JDBC.

<H2><A NAME="VRMLExtensionswithIcedJavaLiquidRe"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>VRML
Extensions with Iced Java/Liquid Reality</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
<I>VRML</I> stands for Virtual Reality Modeling Language. VRML
was designed as a standard to create 3D worlds. A VRML file contains
all the object information needed to create a virtual world. In
order for an application to display the virtual world defined
in a VRML file, the application needs two components: a three-dimensional
modeling engine and a VRML interpreter.
<H3><A NAME="ThreeDimensionalModeling">Three-Dimensional Modeling</A>
</H3>
<P>
One of the commercially available 3D modeling engine libraries
for Java is called Iced Java. Iced Java, by Dimension X, provides
Java with the capability to display and render 3D objects. Iced
Java utilizes a native code engine to perform the actual 3D modeling
and rendering, and an interface is provided to allow Java access
to the engine.
<H3><A NAME="IcedJavaandLiquidReality">Iced Java and Liquid Reality</A>
</H3>
<P>
As mentioned before, VRML is a language designed to create a virtual
world. To facilitate the display of the VRML defined world, a
3D display engine must be teamed with a VRML interpreter. This
is exactly what Dimension X did to create its Liquid Reality product.
Iced Java is driven by Liquid Reality to generate the VRML-defined
world.

<P>
The Java products identified in this chapter represent only a
small sample of the products that have been introduced at the
time this book is being written. New platforms and extensions
to Java will continue to be developed. For more information on
