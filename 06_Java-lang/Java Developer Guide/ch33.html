<FONT COLOR=#000000>In this chapter you will be introduced to
the JavaScript language. You'll examine the relationship between
the Java programming language and JavaScript. You will learn how
JavaScript and HTML are used to create advanced Web pages. At
the end of this chapter, you will have a firm understanding of
the constraints, capabilities, and uses of JavaScript.</FONT>

<P>
When choosing a programming language, a primary concern is whether
the language can do what you want. When languages overlap in capability,
this issue can become cloudy. To solve this dilemma, you need
to look at a number of different qualities provided by each approach.
If it is still a tie, pick the one that is easier to use. This
decision process describes the choice between Java and JavaScript.
Both languages supply some of the same capabilities while retaining
their own unique functionality.
<P>
The first obvious difference between the two languages is that
JavaScript is a scripting language, whereas Java is fully compiled.
Both Java and JavaScript retain the majority of the same C-type
syntax, but JavaScript is a loosely typed language and Java is
strongly typed. JavaScript is referred to as <I>loosely typed</I>
because it does not require that the type of a variable be identified
when the variable is declared and because it automatically converts
values of one type to another. Java is referred to as a <I>strongly
typed</I> language because it requires that all variables be declared
to be a unique type and because it does not automatically convert
values from one type to another.
<P>
Both Java and JavaScript support the same primitive data types:
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">numeric</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">string</FONT></TT>,
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">boolean</FONT></TT>. They also support
functions in a slightly different way. Due to the loosely typed
syntax of JavaScript, function definitions are also loosely typed.
This means that the type of the return value of a function does
not have to be specified.
<P>
Java and JavaScript provide similar capabilities. Each does, however,
offer some unique capabilities. For JavaScript the majority of
these capabilities pertain to its ability to exist within an HTML
document. Java's strengths stem from the fact that it is a compiled
language and, as such, is not confined to the limitations of a
scripting environment. Table 33.1 shows a comparison of the two
languages.<BR>

JavaScript Works </FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Unlike Java, whose code is compiled and stored in a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.class</FONT></TT>
file, the JavaScript code is embedded inside an HTML document.
A Java applet is executed within a separate applet window of the
browser's display. JavaScript, on the other hand, becomes an active
element of the HTML document, and in doing so, has the capability
to modify elements of the displayed Web page.
<P>
When the browser sees the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">JavaScript</FONT></TT>
tag inside the HTML, it begins compiling the information needed
to interpret the script. The script does not begin execution until
the entire page has been laid out, at which time the script begins
executing. It is true that the script has the capability to modify
the appearance of the current page; however, it does need to abide
by the update policy of the browser. After the browser has laid
out the page, the script has to reload the page before any changes
can be seen. There is a way around this: The script can update
a region inside a frame without updating the entire page.
<P>
JavaScript is a powerful tool for Web development, but it shouldn't
be viewed as a direct alternative to Java. Rather, Java and JavaScript
can work in tandem to provide a wide range of application possibilities.

</FONT></H2>
<P>
With Java applets, HTML serves as a command line of sorts to execute
the applet. From the HTML command line, parameters can be sent
into the applet. However, the communication with HTML is strictly
one-way. The applet does not have the capability to modify the
content of the HTML document. Herein lies the distinct difference
between JavaScript and Java.
<P>
JavaScript is a script language that resides and is executed from
within the HTML code. You can think of JavaScript in the same
way as any other HTML language element: A script is interpreted
and then executed from within the browser. In this manner, the
script is handled in the same way as a frame. Executing the script
from within the browser allows the script to have access to other
elements of the HTML page-in a sense, allowing the script to dynamically
change the content of the page.

<P>
To add a script to an HTML document, you use the <I>script tag</I>.
It is a surrounding tag and is written as <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</FONT></TT>. The
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">LANGUAGE</FONT></TT> attribute is set
to the value <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">JavaScript</FONT></TT> to
indicate that the script is a JavaScript script. All JavaScript
code must be contained between the opening and closing script
tags, as shown in the following example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
<BR>
JavaScript statements...<BR>
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;<BR>
</FONT></TT>

<P>
<P>
Browsers that do not support JavaScript should ignore the statements
contained within the script tags. The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">LANGUAGE<B>
</B></FONT></TT>attribute can be omitted because JavaScript is
currently supported only by Netscape browsers and is the only
scripting language supported by these browsers. However, it is
good practice to include the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">LANGUAGE</FONT></TT>
attribute in case other scripting languages become widely supported.
<P>
JavaScript objects can be placed wherever you want on a Web page;
however, it is a good idea to declare all functions in the head
portion of the document. This assures that the functions are declared
before the page is displayed, eliminating the possibility that
a user might execute a function before it has been declared.

Scripts with Applets</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000> </FONT>
</H2>
<P>
JavaScript has the capability to dynamically alter a Web page
by generating new HTML elements to be displayed. Whether the HTML
is created in response to an event or simply generated during
the course of the script program, the HTML generated can be used
to update a Web document's display. Keep in mind that applets
are executed from an HTML tag reference. This means that HTML
generated by JavaScript could very well execute a Java applet.
<P>
By launching an applet in response to an event, your HTML has
the capability to take on an entirely new level of functionality.
If the concept of launching an applet from a script seems a little
confusing, see the examples in <A HREF="ch34.html" >Chapter 34</A>,
&quot;Sample Scripts.&quot;

<P>
In this chapter you have been introduced to the JavaScript language.
You have seen how JavaScript is embedded into HTML documents.
You have learned the differences between JavaScript and Java,
as well as the strengths and weaknesses of both. You have also
learned how applets and JavaScript can function together to create
attractive Web pages. In <A HREF="ch34.html" >Chapter 34</A>, you
will see examples of JavaScript and will be provided with the
in-depth information you need to create your own scripts with
JavaScript.
