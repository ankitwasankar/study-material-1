Programming languages, like their spoken-language kin, evolve

over time. They are constantly refined and focused to meet the

ever-changing needs of their users. Like other modern programming

languages such as C++, Java is an amalgamation of all the techniques

developed over the years. Therefore, we'll start exploring object-oriented

programming (OOP) by briefly looking at the history of programming

languages. Knowing where object-oriented ideas came from will

help you to better understand why they are an important part of

modern programming languages. Once you understand why OOP was

developed, you'll learn exactly what makes a programming language

object-oriented.

<H2><A NAME="FromSwitchestoObjects"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

From Switches to Objects</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Back in the dark ages of computing, technicians programmed computers

by flipping banks of switches, with each switch representing a

single bit of information. In those days, even the simple programs

required agonizing patience and precision. As the need for more

sophisticated programs grew, so did the need for better ways to

write these programs. The need to make computer programming quicker

and simpler spurred the invention of assembly language and, shortly

thereafter, high-level languages such as FORTRAN.

<P>

High-level languages enable programmers to use English-like commands

in their programs and to be less concerned with the details of

programming a computer and more concerned with the tasks that

need to be completed. For example, in assembly language-a low-level

language-it might take several instructions to display a line

of text on the screen. In a high-level language, there's usually

a single command such as <TT>PRINT </TT>that accomplishes this

task.

<P>

With the advent of high-level languages, programming became accessible

to more people; writing program code was no longer exclusively

the domain of specially trained scientists. As a result, computing

was used in increasingly complex roles. It was soon clear, however,

that a more efficient way of programming was needed, one that

would eliminate the obscure and complex &quot;spaghetti code&quot;

that the early languages produced.

<P>

Programmers needed a new way of using high-level languages, one

that enabled them to partition their programs into logical sections

that represented the general tasks to be completed. Thus, the

structured-programming paradigm was born. Structured programming

encourages a top-down approach to programming, in which the programmer

focuses on the general functions that a program must accomplish

rather than the details of how those functions are implemented.

When programmers think and program in top-down fashion, they can

more easily handle large projects without producing tangled code.

<P>

For an analogy, consider an everyday task such as cleaning a house.

If you wanted to write out the steps needed to complete this task,

you'd write something like this:

<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The preceding list of steps is similar, in theory, to how you'd

program a computer without using a top-down approach. Using the

top-down programming approach, you'd revise the &quot;program&quot;

as follows:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Now, if you're only interested in seeing what the &quot;program&quot;

does, you can glance at the top level and see that these are instructions

for cleaning the living room, kitchen, and bedroom. If that's

all you need to know, you need to look no further. If, however,

you want to know exactly how to clean the living room, you can

go down one level in the top-down structure and find the detailed

instructions for cleaning the living room. Yes, the top-down approach

tends to make programs longer, but it also adds clarity to the

program, because you can hide the details until you really need

them.

<P>

Today, the need for efficient programming methods is more important

than ever. The size of the average computer program has grown

dramatically and now consists of hundreds of thousands of code

lines. (It's rumored that Windows 95 comprises as much as 15 million

lines of code. It boggles the mind!) With these huge programs,

reusability is critical. Again, a better way of programming is

needed-and that better way is object-oriented programming.

<H2><A NAME="AnObviousYetBrilliantSolution"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

An Obvious, Yet Brilliant, Solution</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The world consists of many objects, most of which manipulate other

objects or data. For example, a car is an object that manipulates

its speed and direction to transport people to a different location.

This car object encapsulates all the functions and data that it

needs to get its job done. It has a switch to turn it on, a wheel

to control its direction, and brakes to slow it down. These functions

directly manipulate the car's data, including direction, position,

and speed.

<P>

When you travel in a car, however, you don't have to know the

details of how these operations work. To stop a car, for example,

you simply step on the brake pedal. You don't have to know how

the pedal stops the car. You simply know that it works.

<P>

All these functions and data work together to define the object

called a car. Moreover, all these functions work very similarly

from one car to the next. You're not likely to confuse a car with

a dishwasher, a tree, or a playground. A car is a complete unit-an

object with unique properties.

<P>

You can also think of a computer program as consisting of objects.

Instead of thinking of a piece of code that, for example, draws

a rectangle on-screen, and another piece of code that fills the

rectangle with text, and still another piece of code that enables

you to move the rectangle around the screen, you can think of

a single object: a window. This window object contains all the

code that it needs in order to operate. Moreover, it also contains

all the data that it needs. This is the philosophy behind OOP.

<H2><A NAME="ObjectOrientedProgramming"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Object-Oriented Programming</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Object-oriented programming enables you to think of program elements

as objects. In the case of a window object, you don't need to

know the details of how it works, nor do you need to know about

the window's private data fields. You need to know only how to

call the various functions (called methods in Java) that make

the window operate. Consider the car object discussed in the previous

section. To drive a car, you don't have to know the details of

how a car works. You need to know only how to drive it. What's

going on under the hood is none of your business. (And, if you

casually try to make it your business, plan to face an amused

mechanic who will have to straighten out your mess!)

<P>

But OOP is a lot more than just a way to hide the details of a

program. To learn about OOP, you need to understand three main

concepts that are the backbone of OOP. These concepts, which are

covered in the following sections, are: encapsulation, inheritance,

and polymorphism.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If you're new to programming, you might want to stop reading at this point and come back to this chapter after you've studied Chapters 5 through 14. It's not possible to discuss concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism without dealing 
with such subjects as data types, variables, and variable scope. If these terms are unfamiliar, move on now to <A HREF="ch5.html" >Chapter 5</A></BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="Encapsulation">

Encapsulation</A></H3>

<P>

One major difference between conventional structured programming

and object-oriented programming is a handy thing called encapsulation.

Encapsulation enables you to hide, inside the object, both the

data fields and the methods that act on that data. (In fact, data

fields and methods are the two main elements of an object in the

Java programming language.) After you do this, you can control

access to the data, forcing programs to retrieve or modify data

only through the object's interface. In strict object-oriented

design, an object's data is always private to the object. Other

parts of a program should never have direct access to that data.

<P>

How does this data-hiding differ from a structured-programming

approach? After all, you can always hide data inside functions,

just by making that data local to the function. A problem arises,

however, when you want to make the data of one function available

to other functions. The way to do this in a structured program

is to make the data global to the program, which gives any function

access to it. It seems that you could use another level of scope-one

that would make your data global to the functions that need it-but

still prevent other functions from gaining access. Encapsulation

does just that. In an object, the encapsulated data members are

global to the object's methods, yet they are local to the object.

They are not global variables.

<H3><A NAME="ClassesasDataTypes">

Classes as Data Types</A></H3>

<P>

An object is just an instance of a data type. For example, when

you declare a variable of type <TT>int</TT>, you're creating an

instance of the <TT>int</TT> data type. A class is like a data

type in that it is the blueprint upon which an object is based.

When you need a new object in a program, you create a class, which

is a kind of template for the object. Then, in your program, you

create an instance of the class. This instance is called an object.

<P>

Classes are really nothing more than user-defined data types.

As with any data type, you can have as many instances of the class

as you want. For example, you can have more than one window in

a Windows application, each with its own contents.

<P>

For example, think again about the integer data type (<TT>int)</TT>.

It's absurd to think that a program can have only one integer.

You can declare many integers, just about all you want. The same

is true of classes. After you define a new class, you can create

many instances of the class. Each instance (called an object)

normally has full access to the class's methods and gets its own

copy of the data members.

<H3><A NAME="Inheritance">

Inheritance</A></H3>

<P>

Inheritance enables you to create a class that is similar to a

previously defined class, but one that still has some of its own

properties. Consider a car-simulation program. Suppose that you

have a class for a regular car, but now you want to create a car

that has a high-speed passing gear. In a traditional program,

you might have to modify the existing code extensively and might

introduce bugs into code that worked fine before your changes.

To avoid these hassles, you use the object-oriented approach:

Create a new class by inheritance. This new class inherits all

the data and methods from the tested base class. (You can control

the level of inheritance with the <TT>public</TT>, <TT>private</TT>,

and <TT>protected</TT> keywords. You'll see how all this works

with Java in <A HREF="ch14.html" >Chapter 14</A>, &quot;Classes.&quot;) Now, you only need

to worry about testing the new code you added to the derived class.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The designers of OOP languages didn't pick the word &quot;inheritance&quot; out of a hat. Think of how human children inherit many of their characteristics from their parents. But the children also have characteristics that are uniquely their own. In 
object-oriented programming, you can think of a base class as a parent and a derived class as a child.</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="Polymorphism">

Polymorphism</A></H3>

<P>

The last major feature of object-oriented programming is polymorphism.

By using polymorphism, you can create new objects that perform

the same functions as the base object but which perform one or

more of these functions in a different way. For example, you may

have a shape object that draws a circle on the screen. By using

polymorphism, you can create a shape object that draws a rectangle

instead. You do this by creating a new version of the method that

draws the shape on the screen. Both the old circle-drawing and

the new rectangle-drawing method have the same name (such as <TT>DrawShape()</TT>)

but accomplish the drawing in a different way.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleEncapsulationInheritanceandPolymorphism">

Example: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism</A></H3>

<P>

Although you won't actually start using Java classes until later

in this book, this is a good time to look at OOP concepts in a

general way. As an example, you'll extend the car metaphor you

read earlier this chapter.

<P>

In that section I described a car as an object having several

characteristics (direction, position, and speed) and several means

(steering wheel, gas pedal, and brakes) to act on those characteristics.

In terms of constructing a class for a car object, you can think

of direction, position, and speed as the class's data fields and

the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brakes as representing the

class's methods.

<P>

The first step in creating an object is to define its class. For

now, you'll use pseudo-code to create a <TT>Car</TT> class. You'll

learn about Java classes in <A HREF="ch14.html" >Chapter 14</A>, &quot;Classes.&quot; The

base <TT>Car</TT> class might look like Listing 4.1.

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Listing 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;LST4_1.TXT: The pseudocode for a Base

Car Class.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

class Car

{

    data direction;

    data position;

    data speed;



    method Steer();

    method PressGasPedal();

    method PressBrake();

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

In this base <TT>Car</TT> class, a car is defined by its direction

(which way its pointed), position (where it's located), and speed.

These three data fields can be manipulated by the three methods

<TT>Steer()</TT>, <TT>PressGasPedal()</TT>, and <TT>PressBrake()</TT>.

The <TT>Steer()</TT> method changes the car's direction, whereas

the <TT>PressGasPedal()</TT> and <TT>PressBrake()</TT> change

the car's speed. The car's position is affected by all three methods,

as well as by the direction and speed settings.

<P>

The data fields and methods are all encapsulated inside the class.

Moreover, the data fields are private to the class, meaning that

they cannot be directly accessed from outside of the class. Only

the class's three methods can access the data fields. In short,

Listing 4.1 not only shows what a class might look like, it also

shows how encapsulation works.

<P>

Now, suppose you want to create a new car that has a special passing

gear. To do this, you can use OOP inheritance to derive a new

class from the <TT>Car</TT> base class. Listing 4.2 is the pseudocode

for this new class.

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Class PassingCar inherits from Car

{

    method Pass();

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

You may be surprised to see how small this new class is. It's

small because it implicitly inherits all the data fields and methods

from the <TT>Car</TT> base class. That is, not only does the <TT>PassingCar</TT>

class have a method called <TT>Pass()</TT>, but it also has the

<TT>direction</TT>, <TT>position</TT>, and <TT>speed</TT> data

fields, as well as the <TT>Steer()</TT>, <TT>PressGasPedal()</TT>,

and <TT>PressBrake()</TT> methods. The <TT>PassingCar</TT> class

can use all these data fields and methods exactly as if they were

explicitly defined in Listing 4.2. This is an example of inheritance.

<P>

The last OOP concept that you'll apply to the car classes is polymorphism.

Suppose that you now decide that you want a new kind of car that

has all the characteristics of a <TT>PassingCar</TT>, except that

its passing gear is twice as fast as <TT>PassingCar</TT>'s. You

can solve this problem as shown in Listing 4.3.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

The <TT>FastCar</TT> class looks exactly like the original <TT>PassingCar</TT>

class. However, rather than just inheriting the <TT>Pass()</TT>

method, it defines its own version. This new version makes the

car move twice as fast as <TT>PassingCar</TT>'s <TT>Pass()</TT>

method does (the code that actually implements each method is

not shown). In this way, the <TT>FastCar</TT> class implements

the same functionality as the <TT>PassingCar()</TT> class, but

it implements that functionality a little differently.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Because the <TT>FastCar</TT> class inherits from <TT>PassingCar</TT>, which itself inherits from <TT>Car</TT>, a <TT>FastCar</TT> also inherits all the data fields and methods of the <TT>Car</TT> class. There are ways that you can control how inheritance 
works (using the <TT>public</TT>, <TT>protected</TT>, and <TT>private</TT> keywords), but you won't get into that until much later in this book.

Java is an object-oriented language, meaning that it can not only

enable you to organize your program code into logical units called

objects, but also that you can take advantage of encapsulation,

inheritance, and polymorphism. Learning OOP, however, can be a

little tricky. If you're a novice programmer, this chapter has

probably left you confused. If so, read on to learn more about

the Java language. Once you start writing Java programs, much

of what you read here will make more sense. After finishing this

part of the book, you might want to reread this chapter and so

reinforce any concepts that may be shady now.
