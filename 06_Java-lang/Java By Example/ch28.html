<P>

Not to state the obvious, but because applets are used on the

Internet, they have the ability to perform a few types of telecommunications

tasks. One of these tasks, connecting to other Web sites, is a

snap to implement. Other tasks, such as accessing data in files,

are difficult to implement because you constantly stumble over

the security restrictions built into applets. Dealing with the

intricacies of Internet security is beyond the scope of this book.

If you're interested in this topic, you should pick up an advanced

Java book. In this chapter, though, you'll get a chance to use

Java to communicate over the Internet by connecting to URLs that

the user supplies.

<H2><A NAME="URLObjects"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

URL Objects</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In the previous chapter, you got a quick introduction to <TT>URL</TT>

objects when you obtained the location of graphics and sound files

by calling the <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT> and <TT>getCodeBase()</TT>

methods. You used the <TT>URL</TT> objects returned by these methods

in order to display images and play sounds that were stored on

your computer. In that case, the locations of the files were on

your own system. What you didn't know then is that you can create

an <TT>URL</TT> object directly by calling its constructor. Using

this technique, you can create <TT>URL</TT> objects that represent

other sites on the World Wide Web.

<P>

Although the <TT>URL</TT> class's constructor has several forms,

the easiest to use requires a string argument holding the URL

from which you want to create the object. Using this constructor,

you create the <TT>URL</TT> object like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

URL url = new URL(str);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This constructor's single argument is the complete URL of the

location to which you want to connect. This URL string must be

properly constructed or the <TT>URL</TT> constructor will throw

an exception (generate an error). You'll soon see what to do about

such errors.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleCreatinganURLObject">

Example: Creating an URL Object</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose you want to create an <TT>URL</TT> object for the URL

<TT>http://www.sun.com</TT>, which is where you can find lots

of information about Java. You'd create the <TT>URL</TT> object

like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

URL url = new URL(&quot;http://www.sun.com&quot;);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

If the <TT>URL</TT> construction goes okay, you can then use the

<TT>URL</TT> object however you need to in your applet.

<H3><A NAME="URLExceptions">

URL Exceptions</A></H3>

<P>

As I mentioned previously, if the argument for the <TT>URL</TT>

constructor is in error (meaning that it doesn't use valid URL

syntax), the <TT>URL</TT> class throws an exception. Because the

<TT>URL</TT> class is designed to throw an exception when necessary,

Java gives you no choice except to handle that exception properly.

This prevents the applet from accidentally attempting to use a

defective <TT>URL</TT> object. You'll learn all the details about

handling exceptions in <A HREF="ch30.html" >Chapter 30</A>, &quot;Exceptions.&quot; For

now, though, you need to know how to handle the <TT>URL</TT> exception

because your applets will not compile properly until you add the

exception-handling code.

<P>

Basically, when you need to watch out for an exception, you enclose

the code that may generate the error in a <TT>try</TT> program

block. If the code in the block generates an exception, you handle

that exception in a <TT>catch</TT> program block. (It's no coincidence

that when code &quot;throws&quot; an exception, Java expects the

program to &quot;catch&quot; that exception.) When you create

an <TT>URL</TT> object from a string, you must watch out for the

<TT>MalformedURLException</TT> exception, which is one of the

many exceptions defined by Java. To do this, use the <TT>try</TT>

and <TT>catch</TT> program blocks, as shown in Listing 28.1.

<H2><A NAME="TheAppletContext"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

The Applet Context</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Once you have the <TT>URL</TT> object created, you need a way

to pass it on to the browser in which the applet is running. It

is the browser, after all, that will make the Web connection for

you. But, how do you refer to the browser from within your applet?

You call the <TT>getAppletContext()</TT> method, which returns

an <TT>AppletContext</TT> object. This <TT>AppletContext</TT>

object represents the browser in which the applet is running.

You call <TT>getAppletContext()</TT> like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

AppletContext context = getAppletContext();

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Once you have the context, you can link to the URL represented

by the <TT>URL</TT> object you already created. You do this by

calling the <TT>AppletContext</TT> object's <TT>showDocument()</TT>

method, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

context.showDocument(url);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

If all goes well, the above line will connect you to the requested

URL.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsinganAppletContexttoLinktoanURL">

Example: Using an AppletContext to Link to an URL</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose that you want to enable the user to enter an URL string

in your applet and then use <TT>URL</TT> and <TT>AppletContext</TT>

objects to link to that URL. Listing 28.2 shows how you might

accomplish this feat of Internet prestidigitation:

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Listing 28.2&nbsp;&nbsp;LST28_2.TXT: Linking to an URL.<BR>

</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

String str = GetURLStringFromUser();



try

{

    URL url = new URL(str);

    AppletContext context = getAppletContext();

    context.showDocument(url);

}

catch (MalformedURLException e)

{

    DisplayErrorMessage();

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

In Listing 28.2, the program first calls a method that retrieves

a text string from the user. This text string is the URL to which

the user wants to connect. Then, the <TT>try</TT> program block

starts. The first line inside the <TT>try</TT> block attempts

to create an <TT>URL</TT> object from the string the user entered.

Of course, because user's often make mistakes when typing in long

strings of characters, the string the user entered may not be

a syntactically valid URL. In that case, program execution automatically

jumps to the <TT>catch</TT> program block, where your applet displays

an appropriate error message. If the <TT>URL</TT> object gets

created okay, though, the program finishes the code in the <TT>try</TT>

block, getting the <TT>AppletContext</TT> object and making the

link to the URL. In this case, Java completely ignores the <TT>catch</TT>

block.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsinganAppletContextinanApplet">

Example: Using an AppletContext in an Applet</A></H3>

<P>

Ready for a full-fledged example? Listing 28.3 is a complete applet

that enables the user to link to an URL. Listing 28.4 is the HTML

document that loads the applet. Because this applet actually interacts

with a browser and the Internet, you must have made your Internet

connection before running the applet. Then, to run the applet,

load its HTML document into a Java-compatible browser such as

Netscape Navigator 2.0. When you do, you'll see a window similar

to that shown in Figure 28.1. In this figure, the user has already

entered the URL he wishes to visit. In Figure 28.2, the browser

has made the requested connection. Figure 28.3 shows the browser

when the user enters an invalid URL string.

Creating a &quot;Favorite URLs&quot; Applet</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Nothing, of course, says that the string from which you create

an <TT>URL</TT> object must be typed in by the user at runtime.

You can hard-code the URLs you want to use right in the applet's

source code, which not only ensures that the URLs will always

be correct (unless the associated server changes), but also makes

it quick and easy to jump to whatever URL you want. Using this

idea, you can put together an applet that gives you pushbutton

control over your connections, selecting your URLs as easily as

you'd select a radio station.

<P>

The ConnectApplet2 applet, shown in Listing 28.5, is just such

an applet. In its current version, it provides four buttons that

give you instant connection to the Web sites represented by the

buttons. Want to jump to Microsoft's Web page? Give the Microsoft

button a click. Want to check out the latest news at Macmillan

Computer Publishing? Click the Macmillan button. Of course, just

as with the original ConnectApplet, you must have your Internet

connection established before you run the applet. And, you must

run the applet from a Java-compatible browser.

<P>

When you run the applet from Netscape Navigator 2.0, you see the

window shown in Figure 28.4. As you can see, the applet currently

displays four buttons, one each for the Sun, Netscape, Microsoft,

and Macmillan Web sites. Just click a button to jump to the associated

site. (Figure 28.5 shows the browser after the user has clicked

the Macmillan button.) When you're through with that site, use

the browser's Back button to return to the ConnectApplet2 applet.

Then, choose another site.

In Listing 28.5, notice how, even though the URLs are hard-coded

into the program, the <TT>action()</TT> method still surrounds

the call to the <TT>URL</TT> constructor with the <TT>try</TT>

and <TT>catch</TT> program blocks. This is because Java insists

that the applet handle the exception should the <TT>URL</TT> class

throw it. If you remove the exception handling, the applet won't

compile. Anyway, having a little extra protection never hurts.

Handling the exception is a good way to test whether your hard-coded

URLs are valid. I've never known a programmer yet who didn't need

to be protected from himself!

<P>

Although a running applet has to deal with many security considerations,

it can usually connect to other Web sites. To do this, the applet

creates an <TT>URL</TT> object representing the site to which

the applet should connect. The applet then instructs the browser

containing the applet to make the connection, by calling the <TT>AppletContext</TT>

object's <TT>showDocument()</TT> method. In spite of the telecommunications

limitations inherent in applets, you can easily create Internet-aware

applets.
