<P>

This book has shown you how to create simple Java programs. When

you start to create larger programs with multiple classes you

will need some tools to help you organize and compile your programming

projects.

<P>

Fortunately there are IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments.

An IDE is a program that lets you group a bunch of files into

a project and thereby increase programmer productivity. Even though

the Java language is still in its infancy the cutting-edge programmers

of the world already have started to create the tools needed to

bring Java into the world of corporate America and mainstream

programming.

<P>

In addition to the basic IDE, a number of tools are becoming available

to help you with programming tasks. For example, there is a program

available that will let you design a dialog box in Visual Basic

and have it automatically converting into Java using the AWT.

<P>

This appendix will take a quick look at the IDEs and tools that

are available for downloading from the World Wide Web. Please

remember that the state-of-the-art in Java development is changing

so rapidly that the any details presented here are almost guaranteed

to be obsolete when you read them. Therefore, only one IDE will

be discussed in depth-to give you an idea what you can expect

in an IDE.

<P>

There are two good ways to find more information about IDEs or

Java tools:

<UL>

<LI>Internet Search Engines&nbsp;&nbsp;These Web sites let you

specify search criteria. Then, the engine will look at its database

and display a list of  Web pages that contain the text you specified.

For example, you could search for &quot;JAVA&quot;, &quot;IDE&quot;,

and &quot;Win95&quot; in order to find Java IDEs that run under

the Windows 95 operating system. The JAVA.html file on the CD-ROM

has links to some good search engines. If you are not already

familiar with them, take the time to use them-they are a great

resource.

<LI>Java UseNet Newsgroup&nbsp;&nbsp;This newsgroup (comp.lang.java)

is where a lot of experienced Java developers hang out, help new

programmers, and discuss the future. You will also see a lot of

new programs being announced here. It should take no more than

10 minutes a day to monitor the newsgroup.

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="IDEs"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

IDEs</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

I believe that the greatest advantage of an IDE is that it acts

to isolate you from the command-line of a compiler. When a source

file needs to be compiled, frequently you will only need to highlight

the file and click a compile icon. The Java compiler will be called

as a subprocess and all compiler messages will be captured into

a window. Typically, you need only click an error message in order

to see the offending source code.

<P>

You will also see gains in both productivity and organization

because you will no longer need to type in the file name each

time a compilation is needed. This will help organization-you

will no longer be reluctant to give your classes (and hence, the

source files) descriptive names because of the amount of typing

needed for each compilation.

<P>

All IDEs work-more or less-in the same manner:

<OL>

<LI>The IDE creates a project file. It is usually a good idea

to isolate each project to its own directory. However, this is

not a hard-and-fast rule. I frequently place small projects or

example programs in the same directory.

<LI>The IDE changes project settings and preferences to reflect

the requirements of the current project. For example, you might

want all of your .class files to be placed into the same directory

when the compiler creates them. Another example might be setting

the command-line options for the compiler.

<LI>The IDE enables you to add source files to the project. Each

project file holds a list of which .java files are used by the

project. Some IDEs will also let you associate .html or .htmll files

with a project. This makes working with applets easier. When creating

new source files, most IDEs will ask if you want to add the new

file to the project.

<LI>A built-in editor allows you to change the source code as

needed.

<LI>You can compile code by selecting a menu option or icon. Messages

from the compiler are captured to a window.

<LI>You can run Appletviewer, Web browser, or Interpreter by selecting

a menu option or icon. This allows you to test your code.

</OL>

In order for any IDE to compile your Java source code, Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK) must already be loaded. It will help if you place the BIN directory of the JDK into your path. This can usually be accomplished by added the following line to your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<TT>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\JDK\BIN;</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Of course, you will need to replace the C:\JDK with the name of the directory in which you installed the JDK.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<P>

Let's take a close look at the Diva IDE. Diva will be used for

the examples in this chapter for several reasons. The most important

being that you can download it from the Net. The file JAVA.html

on the CD has a link that you can use to download Diva. Once you

have created a project in Diva, you will probably be able to adapt

to any Java IDE with ease.

<H3><A NAME="Diva">

Diva</A></H3>

<P>

It is important to note that the version of Diva that is described

here is an alpha version. The version that you download and use

might look different.

<P>

Before you can follow along with the examples shown below, you

will need to install both Sun's Java Developement Kit (JDK) and

Diva. I'll assume that you already know how to install the JDK.

Diva is installed by uncompressing the DIVA.ZIP. I'll use C:\DIVA

as the base directory for the following examples, but you can

use any directory you'd like.

<H4>An Example</H4>

<P>

In this example you will use Diva to create an application that

displays a window-called a frame in Java-that responds to the

user's clicking the Close button. Follow these steps:

<OL>

<LI>Start Diva by double-clicking the DIVA.EXE file in the C:\DIVA

directory.

<LI>Select the File, Create New Project menu option to display

the Create New Javaside Project dialog box, as shown in Figure

C.1<BR>

<IMG SRC="fc-1.gif"><B>Figure C.1 :</B> <I>The Create New Project dialog box.</I></A>

<LI>Enter myFrame into the file name field and click the Save

button to close the dialog box. The Diva screen should now look

like Figure C.2<BR>

<IMG SRC="fc-2.gif"><B>Figure C.2</B> : <I>The Diva IDE</I>.</A>

<LI>Select File, New File to display the New dialog box. Then

select Java in the choice list and click the OK button to close

the dialog box. Diva will create another window to hold the contents

of the new file as shown in Figure C.3. I added the text &quot;Enter

text here&quot; to the new file so that you could easily see which

window was added.<BR>

<IMG SRC="fc-3.gif"><B>Figure C.3</B> : <I>An almost empty Java File in the Diva IDE</I>.</A>

<LI>Enter Listing C.1 into the editor window.

You'll notice that the color of various words change as you enter the listing into the Diva editor. This cool feature is called syntax highlighting.</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<LI>Enter Listing D.1 into the editor window. When done, select

File, Save and use myFrame.java as the file name. The file name

and the class name must be identical in order to compile. As you

save, Diva will ask if you want to add the file to the current

project. Say yes. The saved file will be added to the myFrame

project, as shown in Figure C.4.<BR>

<IMG SRC="fc-4.gif"><B>Figure C.4</B> : <I>myFrame.java is now part of the myFrame project</I>.</A>

<LI>Select Build, Compile Active Java File. This will start the

javac compiler. Any messages produced by the compiler will be

displayed in the window along the bottom of the IDE.

<LI>Right-click the myJava.java file in the project window, and

then select Project Settings from the context menu. The Settings

for the open project dialog box should appear with the Files tab

displayed. If not, select the Files tab.

<LI>Click myFrame.java entry in the list and then click Mark as

&quot;main.&quot; This lets Diva know which Java file contains

the main procedure. You'll notice that myFrame.java is now marked

with a yellow star in the project window. You click OK to close

the dialog box.

<LI>Click Build, Run Java to display the Run java dialog box.

Then, click the Run button to actually start the Java interpreter.

First, a DOS Window will appear entitled Java Console and then

the myFrame application will appear.

<LI>Click the Close button to exit the myFrame application.

</OL>

<P>

The Java console will continue running after the Java application

is finished. Leave it running. It will be used for the next interpreted

Java program that you run. After you close Diva, you can click

the Close button of the DOS window to close it also. Be warned,

however, that it may take a while to close.

<H4>The Hierarchy Window</H4>

<P>

The middle window in the top row of the Diva IDE shows the hierarchy

of the open Java file. Figure C.5 shows the Hierarchy window for

myFrame.java file.

<P>

<IMG SRC="fc-5.gif"><B>Figure C.5</B> : <I>The Hierarchy window for myFrame.java</I>.</A>

<P>

The Hierarchy window is very useful because you can collapse and

expand sections of the file so that it's easy to see what a file

contains-handy when looking at someone else's code. You'll also

see that all of the procedures are shown. You can click any procedure

name, and its corresponding code will be displayed.

<H4>Other Features</H4>

<P>

Diva has a primitive user interface design ability. You access

this by creating a new file and selecting Diva Design Document

as the new file type. However, very little documentation exists

for this feature. You might be better off waiting for the beta

version.

<P>

You can also use Diva to automatically generate skeleton code

to handle a variety of common programming situations. Figure C.6

shows part of the list of code snippets that Diva has available.

You access this list by selecting Edit, Insert Skeleton Code.

<P>

<IMG SRC="fc-6.gif"><B>Figure C.6</B> : <I>Diva lets you insert code snippets by selecting from a list</I>.</A>

<P>

You can also add your own code to the list of snippets so that

you can share code with other programmers or simply avoid retyping.

<H3><A NAME="Java">

Java+</A></H3>

<P>

The Java+ IDE, shown in Figure C.7, seems to be designed to work

with applets. You can compile your Java classes and the IDE will

display any compiler messages in a separate window. This IDE does

not use project files to group source files. Therefore, it is

useful for only small development projects.

<P>

<IMG SRC="fc-7.gif"><B>Figure C.7</B> : <I>The myFrame.java file inside the Java+ IDE</I>.</A>

<H3><A NAME="JavaMaker">

JavaMaker</A></H3>

<P>

This is another IDE that automates the compilation process. It

does have a nice Print Preview mode so that you can see how your

Java code will print. Some people like to try to have only one

procedure per page so that the code is more understandable. You

can also launch the compiler and Appletviewer from inside the

IDE. Figure C.8 shows what the myFrame.java file and the output

of the compiler looks like inside the JavaMaker IDE.

<P>

<IMG SRC="fc-8.gif"><B>Figure C.8</B> : <I>The myFrame.java file inside the JavaMaker IDE</I>.</A>

<H2><A NAME="Tools"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Tools</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

There are some programs out on the Net that are not directly related

to compiling and running Java programs. Some programs will help

you create a base program to start your project, and some will

help with finding Java documentation.

<P>

This section describes a few of the tools that are available.

<H3><A NAME="AppletGen">

AppletGen</A></H3>

<P>

This extremely useful program is a source code generator. AppletGen

creates a skeleton applet customized according to your needs.

It has no provisions to help you compile or edit the code; it

simply generates a text file. However, this ability might come

in very handy. For example, it will free you from needing to remember

how to add a menu to a frame. If you specify that your applet

needs a menu, the basic menu code will be added to the text file.

<P>

When AppletGen is first started, you will see the window shown

in Figure C.9.

<P>

<IMG SRC="fc-9.gif"><B>Figure C.9</B> : <I>The AppletGen program</I>.</A>

<P>

As you can see, AppletGen has eight tabs. Here is a summary of

the tabs:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Applet Info-This tab lets you add some documentation to your applet.

You can also specify which packages you need to import.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Applet Tab-This tab lets you specify the information that will

be added to the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> HTML tag when AppletGen

generates a HTML file. You can also list out the parameters needed

for your applet.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Applet Attributes-This tab has two subtabs. One, called Options,

lets you select the font, colors, and determine if menus, frames,

or a stand-alone app is used. The other, called Constants, lets

you enter a list of constants that your applet will be using.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Events-This tab lets you select which events your applet will

respond to. Procedure stubs will be created for each events that

you select.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Threading-Shown in Figure D.9 above, this tab will let you specify

information about how you would like threads to be used in your

application.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

URLs-You can indicate which URLs your applet will be using as

a resource.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Resources-This is a listing of the AU, GIF, or JPEG files that

your applet will be using. If the files are not local, the resource

names defined on the URLs tab will be used.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Code Options-This tab lets you determine which types of files

AppletGen will create. You can choose to create HTML, Java Code,

Documentation, Debug info, and an INI file. The INI file stores

all of the choices that you made during the AppletGen session.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Code Window-This tab displays the Source code that AppletGen has

created. You can also see the HTML and INI files. Each type of

file has its own subtab. You need to click the button near the

file name (top left of the tab) in order to save the files.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The AppletGen program is great if you are just learning Java.

By changing the options on the various tabs and then looking at

the source code that is generated, you will be able to see a lot

of different situations. In addition, you can always recreate

any given situation if you need a base of code to start developing

from.

<P>

This has been a small sampling of the IDEs and tools available

to you for downloading from the net. By monitoring the comp.lang.java

newsgroup, or searching the Alta Vista for Java + IDE, you can

easily find others. Take a few moments to look at each tool to

see if it will be useful to you. Every programmer uses a different

set of utilities and it takes effort to find the set that is right

for you.

<P>

One important determinate of which tools to use is the scope of

your project. If you are just learning Java, your tools should

be simple and easy to learn. If you are an accomplished programmer,

using a complicated tool with many options might make more sense.

Similarly, if you are developing a large program, a tool that

tracks many files in a project-oriented way like Diva will be

more useful than Java+, which does not.

<P>

Finally, the Java language itself is still evolving. It will change

and so will the tools that support it. Java has a bright future

ahead. Don't be blinded by it and don't wait for the perfect tool.

Start coding today!
