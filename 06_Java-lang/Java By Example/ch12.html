<P>

Until now, your programs have been pretty short, each designed

to demonstrate a single programming technique. When you start

writing real programs, however, you'll quickly discover that they

can grow to many pages of code. When programs get long, they also

get harder to organize and read. To overcome this problem, professional

programmers break their programs down into individual functions,

each of which completes a specific and well-defined task.

<H2><A NAME="TheTopDownApproachtoProgramming"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

The Top-Down Approach to Programming</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

As I said, long programs are hard to organize and read. A full-length

program contains many pages of code, and trying to find a specific

part of the program in all that code can be tough. You can use

modular program-design techniques to solve this problem. Using

modular programming techniques, you can break a long program into

individual modules, each of which performs a specific task.

<P>

In <A HREF="ch4.html" >Chapter 4</A> &quot;Object-Oriented Programming Concepts,&quot;

you got a quick look at modular program design, which is also

known as structured programming. In that chapter, I used the example

of cleaning a house as a way to understand the process of breaking

tasks up into specific steps. (The only reasonable way to clean

my house is to douse it with gasoline and throw in a lighted match,

but we won't get into that now.) You'll use that metaphor again

here, in preparation for learning about functions.

<P>

When cleaning a house, the main task might be called CLEAN HOUSE.

Thinking about cleaning an entire house, however, can be overwhelming.

So, to make the task easier, you can break it down into a number

of smaller steps. These steps might be CLEAN LIVING ROOM, CLEAN

BEDROOM, CLEAN KITCHEN, and CLEAN BATHROOM.

<P>

After breaking the housecleaning task down into room-by-room steps,

you have a better idea of what to do. But cleaning a room is also

a pretty big task-especially if it hasn't been done in a while

or if you have cats coughing up fur balls all over the place.

So why not break each room step down, too? For example, cleaning

the living room could be broken down into PICK UP ROOM, DUST AND

POLISH, CLEAN FURNITURE, and VACUUM RUG.

<P>

After breaking each room's cleaning down into steps, your housecleaning

job is organized much like a pyramid, with the general task on

the top. As you work your way down the pyramid, from the main

task to the room-by-room list and finally to the tasks for each

room, the tasks get more and more specific.

<P>

Of course, when cleaning a house, you don't usually write a list

of steps. If you're an efficient housecleaner, the steps are organized

in your mind. (If you clean house like I do, there are only two

steps: TURN ON TV and COLLAPSE ON COUCH.) However, when writing

a program, which is a more conceptual task, you may not have a

clear idea of exactly what needs to be done. This can lead to

your being overwhelmed by the project.

<P>

Breaking programming tasks down into steps, or modules, is called

modular programming. And when you break your program's modules

down into even smaller modules-as we did with the task of cleaning

a house-you're using a top-down approach to program design. By

using top-down programming techniques, you can write any program

as a series of small, easy-to-handle tasks. In Java, the basic

unit for organizing code in a top-down manner is the function.

<H2><A NAME="ExampleUsingFunctionsasSubroutines"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Example: Using Functions as Subroutines</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

When programmers talk about subroutines, they usually mean program

modules that return no value to your program. In a way, a subroutine

is like a small program within your main program. If you write

a housecleaning program, the subroutines in the main module might

be called <TT>CleanLivingRoom()</TT>, <TT>CleanBedroom()</TT>,

<TT>CleanKitchen()</TT>, and <TT>CleanBathroom()</TT>. The <TT>CleanLivingRoom()</TT>

subroutine would contain all the steps needed to clean the living

room, the <TT>CleanBedroom()</TT> subroutine would contain all

the steps needed to clean a bedroom, and so on.

<P>

Of course, it takes an extremely talented programmer to get a

computer to clean a house. (If you manage that trick, contact

me immediately.) We need a more computer-oriented example. Suppose

you want to write a program that displays game instructions on-screen.

Listing 12.1 shows one way you might accomplish this task in a

Java applet. Figure 12.1 shows what the applet looks like.

Applet13 is about the simplest applet you can write. All it does

is display text. The text comprises instructions for playing a

simple number game. If you had to sum up in a couple of words

the task performed by Applet13's <TT>paint()</TT> method, you

might come up with something like &quot;Draw Instructions,&quot;

which is an excellent name for a function to handle that task.

Listing 12.2 is a new version of the applet that isolates the

instruction-display task in its own function. When you run this

applet, it looks identical to Applet13.

<P>

Now for the million-dollar question: How does this Applet14 work?

The program is divided into two functions. The first is the <TT>paint()</TT>

method, which Java calls whenever the applet's display area must

be redrawn. In this applet, <TT>paint()</TT> is at the highest

level of your top-down design. That is, no other part of the program

calls <TT>paint()</TT>, but <TT>paint()</TT> calls functions that

are lower in level.

<P>

<CENTER>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>NOTE</B></TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

You might be confused about the difference between methods, functions, and subroutines. The truth is that they are very similar. Specifically, a method is a function that is part of a class. So, in Applet14, both <TT>paint()</TT> and 
<TT>DrawInstructions()</TT> are methods of the <TT>Applet14</TT> class. (They are also functions.) A subroutine is a function that returns no value. That is, it has the word <TT>void</TT> in front of its name.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

The second function in Listing 12.2 is the <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT>

subroutine, which is really just a Java function that returns

no value to the calling function (<TT>paint()</TT>, in this case).

<TT>DrawInstructions()</TT> is one level down from the main program

in the top-down design. In <TT>paint()</TT>, instead of having

all the code that's needed to display the instructions, you only

have a line that calls the function that handles this task. This

makes it easier to see what's going on in <TT>paint()</TT>. If

you need to see more detail, you can always drop down a level

in your program and take a look at <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT>.

<H2><A NAME="DefiningandCallingFunctions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Defining and Calling Functions</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

There are two things you must do to use a function in a program.

The first thing you must do is define the function, which means

that you must write all the program instructions that make up

the function, placing the instructions between curly braces. You

must also determine what arguments the function must have in order

to perform its task. In Applet14, the <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT>

function definition looks like Listing 12.3.

    g.drawString(&quot;between 0 and 100. You have an&quot;, 48, 95);

    g.drawString(&quot;unlimited number of tries.&quot;, 48, 110);

    g.drawString(&quot;Good Luck.&quot;, 95, 140);

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

The first line of Listing 12.3 tells Java the type of value returned

from the function, the name of the function, and the arguments

that must be sent to the function when it's called. In this case,

the type of return value is <TT>void</TT>, which means the function

returns no value. The name of the function is <TT>DrawInstructions</TT>,

and its argument is a <TT>Graphics</TT> object called <TT>g</TT>.

(Notice that, in the function's first line, you must list both

the argument type and argument name.) If you look at the <TT>paint()</TT>

method, you can see that Applet14 calls the <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT>

function like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

DrawInstructions(g);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This line tells Java that you want to execute the program code

in the <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT> function and that you want

to pass the <TT>Graphics</TT> object <TT>g</TT> to the function.

<TT>DrawInstructions()</TT> needs access to <TT>g</TT> because

it is the <TT>Graphics</TT> object that has the <TT>drawString()</TT>

method. Without access to the <TT>Graphics</TT> object, <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT>

cannot perform its task in the same way that the <TT>drawString()</TT>

method cannot display a string unless you give it the string and

the location at which to display the string.

<P>

The second thing you must do to use a function is to call the

function. When you call a function, program execution jumps to

the commands that make up the function. All commands in the function

are executed, after which the program returns to the line after

the function call.

<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>NOTE</B></TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The arguments you place between the parentheses of a function call must be of the same type and in the same order as the arguments given in the function's first line. That is, the call <TT>DrawInstructions(g)</TT> and the first line of the function, 
<TT>DrawInstructions(Graphics g)</TT>, match perfectly because the function call sends a <TT>Graphics</TT> object and the function expects a <TT>Graphics</TT> object. The names of the arguments, however, don't have to match. For example, the function call 
<TT>DrawInstructions(g)</TT> and the function name <TT>DrawInstructions(Graphics graph)</TT> are still a match. The only difference is that you'd have to refer to <TT>graph</TT> inside the <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT> function, rather than to <TT>g</TT>.

Example: Using Functions to Return Values</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In Java, functions are the main way you can break up your programs

into modules. But unlike when you used functions as subroutines,

some types of functions return a value to the main program. You've

used this type of Java function before in this book. The <TT>String</TT>

class' <TT>valueOf()</TT> method is one. The value it returns

is the numerical value of a string containing digits.

<P>

You can assign a function's return value to a variable. Suppose

you have a function named <TT>GetNum()</TT> that calculates a

number and returns it to your program. A call to the function

might look something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

int num = GetNum();

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The function might look something like Listing 12.4.

int GetNum()

{

    ++value;

    return value;

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

Listing 12.4 shows some of the differences between using functions

as subroutines (which return no value) and using functions to

return values. While functions being used as subroutines always

start with the keyword <TT>void</TT>, functions that return values

start with the keyword <TT>int</TT>, <TT>char</TT>, <TT>float</TT>

or whatever type of return value you need. Also, since subroutines

return no value, they need no <TT>return</TT> statement. But as

you can see, the <TT>GetNum()</TT> function returns a value by

using the <TT>return</TT> keyword along with the value to be returned.

If you fail to include the <TT>return</TT> command in the body

of a function that returns a value, Java's compiler will give

you an error message.

Normally, arguments passed into a function are <I>passed by value</I>, which means that a copy of the passed value is given to the function. When you change the value of the argument in the function, you are changing the copy, while the original value 
stays the same. However, some arguments are <I>passed by reference</I>, which means that the original object is passed to the function. In this case, changing the argument's value in the function changes the original value, too. You learn about passing by 
reference in <A HREF="ch13.html" >Chapter 13</A>, &quot;Arrays.&quot;

<P>

When you run Applet15, the program selects a random numeral from

1 to 100. Your task is to guess the numeral in the least number

of tries. You type your guesses into the box at the top of the

applet. When the program starts, this box contains the number

50, and the hint at the bottom of the screen tells you whether

the number is high or low. Each time you enter a new number, the

hint tells you whether the guess is high or low.

<P>

Yes, it's true that Applet15 is much larger than the example applets

you've used so far in this book, but the program needs to be long

in order to accommodate several different functions. By analyzing

the program's flow, you can determine whether or not you understand

how functions work.

<P>

Start with the <TT>paint()</TT> method. By examining the function

calls it contains, you can get a good idea of what the program

does. Specifically, the program displays the game's instructions,

gets a guess from the user, and then displays a message to the

user. If you were only interested in examining the <TT>paint()</TT>

method, you wouldn't have to go any further; the details of how

these other functions work are tucked out of your way.

<P>

If you wanted to see exactly how the program prints the game's

instructions, however, you could find the <TT>DrawInstructions()</TT>

method in the source code. The same is true for the other functions

called in the <TT>paint()</TT> method.

<P>

You can see that some of the functions return values and others

don't. Similarly, some functions require arguments and others

don't. How the function is constructed depends on whether it must

calculate and return a value to the program (such as in <TT>CreateNumber()</TT>)

and whether the function requires values from the program in order

to perform its task (such as <TT>ShowMessage()</TT>, which needs

the <TT>Graphics</TT> object and the player's latest guess).

<P>

There are probably several lines of Java source code in Listing

12.5 that don't make sense to you right now. The pseudocode section

following the listing describes, in general, what the program

is doing. You'll learn about many of the details in other chapters.

At this point, you only need to worry about being able to follow

the function calls.

<H2><A NAME="Summary"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Summary</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Functions enable you to break complicated programs down into easy-to-handle

chunks. Moreover, by using a top-down structure, your programs

can organize code with functions that start off being general

in nature but get more detailed as you work your way deeper into

the hierarchy. When a function doesn't return a value (has a return

type of <TT>void</TT>), it is used as a subroutine, which simply

performs some task before program execution jumps back to the

line after the line that called the function. A function with

a return type other than <TT>void</TT> enables your programs to

calculate a value and return the value to the calling function.

Either type of function can have one or more arguments, which

enable the program to pass values into the function.

<LI>Write a function that prints a two-line message to the user.

<LI>Write a function that returns the number 1 as an integer.

<LI>Write a function that accepts two integer arguments and returns

the sum of the arguments.

<LI>Modify the function from exercise 3 so that it sums the two

arguments, calls yet another function that multiplies the two

arguments, sums the product and the original sum, and returns

the result. Write the function that performs the multiplication.

<LI>Modify Applet15 by adding a function that starts the game

over each time the user guesses the number. That is, after the

user guesses the number, the program should select a new random

number and continue the game. Name the program <TT>GuessApplet.java</TT>.

(You can find the solution to this programming problem in the

CHAP12 folder of this book's CD-ROM.)
