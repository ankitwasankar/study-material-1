<P>

Without a doubt, expressions are the main building blocks of a

program. This is because there are so many different kinds of

expressions that a majority of the source-code lines in a program

end up being-you guessed it-expressions. There are expressions

that result in numerical values. There are expressions that result

in strings. There are simple expressions, complex expressions,

and all manner of expressions in between.

<P>

In the previous chapter, you got a quick look at some kinds of

expressions as you put the mathematical operators to work. Now

you'll learn not only more about those types of expressions, but

also about logical expressions, which help a computer seem to

be able to think and make choices. Along the way, you'll discover

comparison and logical operators, which make logical expressions

possible.

<H2><A NAME="TypesofExpressions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Types of Expressions</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

To put it simply, an expression is a line of code that can be

reduced to a value or that assigns a value. For example, you know

that the addition operator adds one expression to another, like

this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

sum = expr1 + expr2;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the preceding line, <TT>expr1</TT> can be something as simple

as the variable <TT>x</TT> or as complex as <TT>(4 + 5) * 2 *

5 / 7 + x / y</TT>. The same goes for <TT>expr2</TT>, of course.

And, in fact, the first example containing <TT>expr1</TT> and

<TT>expr2</TT> is an expression itself!

<P>

But no matter how complicated, all expressions can be classified

into one of three main categories:

<UL>

<LI>Numerical expressions combine numbers, variables, or constants

using mathematical operators. An example is <TT>2 + 3 / x</TT>.

<LI>Assignment expressions assign a value to a variable. An example

is <TT>num = 3</TT>.

<LI>Logical expressions are unique in that they result in a value

of <TT>true</TT> or <TT>false</TT>. An example is x &lt; 3 (which

reads &quot;x is less than 3&quot;).

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ExpressionsWithinExpressions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Expressions Within Expressions</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In the previous chapter, whether you were aware of it or not,

you used lots of numerical and assignment expressions as you learned

about mathematical operators. And if you look closely at some

of those expressions, you'll make a neat discovery: Like a bunch

of boxes that fit into each other, expressions often contain other

simpler expressions. For example, look at the following assignment

expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

num = (5 - x) * (2 + y);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This is an assignment expression because it assigns a value to

the variable <TT>num</TT>. However, the stuff on either side of

the equals sign contains these other expressions:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

num

(5 - x) * (2 + y)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Both of the above lines are numerical expressions because they

can be reduced to a numerical value (assuming that you know the

values of <TT>num</TT>, <TT>x</TT>, and <TT>y</TT>.

<P>

But, wait a second-you're not done yet. You can still find more

sub-expressions. Look at the multiplication operation. Can you

see that it's multiplying two expressions together? Those two

expressions look like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(5 - x)

(2 + y)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

And the above simplified expressions contain yet more sub-expressions.

Those  expressions are:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

5

x

2

y

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Expressions are what programmers like to call recursive, meaning

that the definition of an expression keeps coming back on itself.

An expression contains expressions that contain other expressions,

which themselves contain other expressions. How deep you can dig

depends on the complexity of the original expression. But, as

you saw demonstrated, even the relatively simple expression <TT>num

= (5 - x) * (2 + y)</TT> has four levels of depth.

<H2><A NAME="ComparisonOperators"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Comparison Operators</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Now that you've dug into the secrets of expressions, it's time

to learn about a new type of operator. So far, you've gotten some

practice with mathematical operators, which enable you to build

various types of numerical and assignment expressions. Another

type of operator you can use to build expressions is the comparison

operator. Comparison operators are used to create logical expressions,

which, if you recall, result in a value of <TT>true</TT> or <TT>false</TT>.

Table 8.1 lists the logical expressions used in Java programming.

C and C++ programmers will find these operators very familiar.

Just how do you use comparison operators? As their name suggests,

you use them to compare two expressions, with the result of the

comparison being either <TT>true</TT> or <TT>false</TT>. For example,

look at this logical expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

3 == 2 + 1

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The result of the above expression is <TT>true</TT> because the

<TT>==</TT> operator determines whether the expressions on either

side are equal to each other. If you were to change the expression

to

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

3 == 2 + 2

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

the result would be <TT>false</TT>. That is, 3 does not equal

4. However, the previous sentence suggests a way to rewrite the

expression, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

3 != 2 + 2

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This expression results in a value of <TT>true</TT>, because 3

does not equal 4.

<P>

The other logical expressions work similarly. Table 8.2 lists

a number of logical expressions and the results they produce.

Logical Operators</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The comparison operators enable you to compare two expressions.

But another type of operator-logical operators-supercharges comparison

operators so that you can combine two or more logical expressions

into a more complex logical expression. Even if you've never programmed

a computer before, you're already familiar with logical operators

because you use them in everyday speech. For example, when you

say, &quot;Do you have a credit card or ten dollars in cash?&quot;

you're using the logical operator OR. Similarly, when you say,

&quot;I have a dog and a cat,&quot; you're using the AND operator.

Table 8.3 lists Java's logical operators and what they mean.<BR>

<P>

<P>

The AND (<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>) operator requires all expressions

to be true for the entire expression to be true. For example,

the expression

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(3 + 2 == 5) &amp;&amp; (6 + 2 == 8)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

is true because the expressions on both sides of the <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>

are true. However, the expression

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 + 3 == 9) &amp;&amp; (3 + 3 == 6)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

is false because the expression on the left of the <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>

is not true. Remember this when combining expressions with AND:

If any expression is false, the entire expression is false.

<P>

The OR operator (<TT>||</TT>) requires only one expression to

be true for the entire expression to be true. For example, the

expressions

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(3 + 6 == 2) || (4 + 4 == 8)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

and

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 + 1 == 5) || (7 + 2 == 9)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

are both true because at least one of the expressions being compared

is true. Notice that in the second case both expressions being

compared are true, which also makes an OR expression true.

<P>

The exclusive OR operator (^) is used to determine if one and

only one of the expressions being compared is true. Unlike a regular

OR, with an exclusive OR, if both expressions are true, the result

is false (weird, huh?). For example, the expression

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(5 + 7 == 12) ^ (4 + 3 == 8)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

evaluates to true, whereas these expressions evaluate to false:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(5 + 7 == 12) ^ (4 + 3 == 7)

(5 + 7 == 10) ^ (4 + 3 == 6)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The NOT (<TT>!</TT>) operator switches the value of (or negates)

a logical expression. For example, the expression

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 + 3 == 5)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

is false; however, the expression

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

!(4 + 3 == 5)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

is true.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingLogicalOperators">

Example: Using Logical Operators</A></H3>

<P>

Take a look at the following expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 + 5 == 9) &amp;&amp; !(3 + 1 = 3)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Is this expression true or false? If you said true, you understand

the way the logical operators work. The expressions on either

side of the &amp;&amp; are both true, so the entire expression

is true. If you said false, you must go to bed without any dinner.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingMultipleLogicalOperators">

Example: Using Multiple Logical Operators</A></H3>

<P>

Just as with mathematical operators, you can use multiple logical

operators to compare several logical expressions. For example,

look at this expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 == 4) &amp;&amp; (5 == 5) &amp;&amp; (6 == 6)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This expression gives a result of <TT>true</TT> because each expression

to the left and right of each AND operator is true. However, this

expression yields a value of false:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 == 4) &amp;&amp; (5 == 6) &amp;&amp; (6 == 6)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Remember that, when using AND, if any sub-expression is false,

the entire expression is false. This is kind of like testifying

in court. To be true, it's got to be the truth, the whole truth,

and nothing but the truth.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleCombiningDifferentComparisonandLogicalOperators">

Example: Combining Different Comparison and Logical Operators

</A></H3>

<P>

Again, just like mathematical operators, there's no restriction

on how you can combine the different comparison and logical operators,

although if you build a very complex expression, you may have

trouble evaluating it yourself. Check out this expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(3 &lt; 5) &amp;&amp; (2 == 2) &amp;&amp; (9 &gt; 6)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Here you've used four different comparison and logical operators

in the same complex expression. But because you're comparing the

sub-expressions with the AND operator, and because each of the

sub-expressions is true, the result of the above expression is

true.

<P>

Now, look at this expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

((3 &lt; 5) &amp;&amp; (2 == 1)) || (7 == 7)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Yep, things are getting tricky. Is the above expression true or

false? (Hey, give it a shot. You've got a fifty-fifty chance.)

Ready for the answer? The above expression is true. First, look

at the parentheses. The outermost parentheses, on the left, group

the two expressions being compared by the AND operator into a

single expression, so evaluate it first. The value 3 is less than

5, but 2 does not equal 1, so the entire expression on the left

of the OR operator is false. On the right of the OR operator,

however, 7 does indeed equal 7, so this sub-expression is true.

Because one of the expressions in the OR comparison is true, the

entire expression is true. Here's how the expression breaks down,

step-by-step:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

((3 &lt; 5) &amp;&amp; (2 == 1)) || (7 == 7)

((true) &amp;&amp; (false)) || (7 == 7)

false || (7 == 7)

false || true

true

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="WritingLogicalExpressions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Writing Logical Expressions</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

You wouldn't write expressions such as

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(4 + 5 == 9) &amp;&amp; !(3 + 1 == 3)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

in your programs. They would serve no purpose because you already

know how the expressions evaluate. However, when you use variables,

you have no way of knowing in advance how an expression may evaluate.

For example, is the expression

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

(num &lt; 9) &amp;&amp; (num &gt; 15)

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

true or false? You don't know without being told the value of

the numerical variable <TT>num</TT>. By using logical operators,

though, your program can do the evaluation, and, based on the

result-<TT>true</TT> or <TT>false</TT>-take the appropriate action.

In the next chapter, which is about <TT>if</TT> and <TT>switch</TT>

statements, you'll see how your programs can use logical expressions

to make decisions.

<H2><A NAME="OrderofOperations"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Order of Operations</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Like all operators, comparison and logical operators have an order

of operations, or operator precedence. When you evaluate a complex

expression, you must be sure to evaluate any sub-expressions in

the correct order. As you learned in the previous example, however,

you can use parentheses to group expressions so that they're easier

to understand or to change the order of operations. Table 8.4

lists the comparison and logical operators in order of precedence.

Expressions, which are lines of Java code that can be reduced

to a value or that assign a value, come in several types. In this

chapter, you not only experimented with numerical and assignment

expressions, but you also learned about logical expressions, which

you create using the comparison and logical operators. Now that

you know how to use comparison and logical operators to build

logical expressions, you're ready to discover how computers make

decisions. You'll make that discovery in the next chapter, where

you'll also start using the operators you learned in order to

write actual applets. Before you turn to that chapter, however,

test your knowledge of expressions, comparison operators, and

logical operators by answering the following review questions

and by completing the review exercises.
