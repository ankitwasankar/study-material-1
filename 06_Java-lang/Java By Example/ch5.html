<P>

If there's one thing that every computer program has in common,

it's that they always process data input and produce some sort

of output based on that data. And because data is so important

to a computer program, it stands to reason that there must be

plenty of different ways to store data so that programs can do

their processing correctly and efficiently. In order to keep track

of data, programs use constants and variables. In this chapter,

you discover what constants and variables are, as well as learn

to use them in the Java language.

<H2><A NAME="Constants"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Constants</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

If you think about the term &quot;constant&quot; for a few moments,

you might conclude that constants must have something to do with

data that never changes. And your conclusion would be correct.

A constant is nothing more than a value, in a program, that stays

the same throughout the program's execution. However, while the

definition of a constant is fairly simple, constants themselves

can come in many different guises. For example, the numeral 2,

when it's used in a line of program code, is a constant. If you

place the word &quot;Java&quot; in a program, the characters that

comprise the word are also constants. In fact, these constant

characters taken together are often referred to as a string constant.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

To be entirely accurate, I should say that text and numerals that are placed in program code are actually called <I>literals</I>, because the value is literally, rather than symbolically, in the program. If this literal and symbolic stuff is confusing 
you, you'll probably have it figured out by the end of this chapter. For now, just know that I'm lumping literals in with constants to simplify the discussion.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

Such values as the numeral 2 and the string constant &quot;Java&quot;

are sometimes called hard-coded values because the values that

represent the constants are placed literally in the program code.

For example, suppose you were writing a program and wanted to

calculate the amount of sales tax on a purchase. Suppose further

that the total purchase in question is $12.00 and the sales tax

in your state is 6 percent. The calculation that'll give you the

sales tax would look like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

tax = 12 * .06;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Suppose now that you write a large program that uses the sales

tax percentage in many places. Then, after you've been happily

using your program for a few months, the state suddenly decides

to raise the sales tax to seven percent. In order to get your

program working again, you have to go through every line of code,

looking for the .06 values that represent the sales tax and changing

them to .07. Such a modification can be a great deal of work in

a large program. Worse, you may miss one or two places in the

code that need to be changed, leaving your program with some serious

bugs.

<P>

To avoid these situations, programmers often use something called

symbolic constants, which are simply words that represent values

in a program. In the case of your sales tax program, you could

choose a word like <TT>SALESTAX</TT> (no spaces) to represent

the current sales tax percentage for your state. Then, at the

beginning of your program, you set <TT>SALESTAX</TT> to be equal

to the current state sales tax. In the Java language, such a line

of program code might look like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

final float SALESTAX = 0.06;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the preceding line, the word <TT>final</TT> tells Java that

this data object is going to be a constant. The <TT>float</TT>

is the data type, which, in this case, is a floating point. (You'll

learn more about data types later in this chapter.) The word <TT>SALESTAX</TT>

is the symbolic constant. The equals sign tells Java that the

word on the left should be equal to the value on the right, which,

in this case, is 0.06.

<P>

After defining the symbolic constant <TT>SALESTAX</TT>, you can

rewrite any lines that use the current sales tax value to use

the symbolic constant rather than the hard-coded value. For example,

the calculation for the sales tax on that $12.00 purchase might

now look something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

tax = 12 * SALESTAX;<BR>

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<CENTER>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In order to differentiate symbolic constants from other values in a program, programmers often use all uppercase letters when naming these constants.</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

Now, when your state changes the sales tax to 7 percent, you need

only change the value you assign to the symbolic constant and

the rest of the program automatically fixes itself. The change

would look like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

final float SALESTAX = 0.07;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="Variables"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Variables</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

If constants are program values that cannot be changed throughout

the execution of a program, what are variables? Variables are

values that can change as much as needed during the execution

of a program. Because of a variable's changing nature, there's

no such thing as a hard-coded variable. That is, hard-coded values

in a program are always constants (or, more accurately, literals).

<P>

Why do programs need variables? Think back to the sales tax program

from the previous section. You may recall that you ended up with

a program line that looked like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

tax = 12 * SALESTAX;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In this line, the word <TT>tax</TT> is a variable. So, one reason

you need variables in a program is to hold the results of a calculation.

In this case, you can think of the word <TT>tax</TT> as a kind

of digital bucket into which the program dumps the result of its

sales tax calculation. When you need the value stored in <TT>tax</TT>,

you can just reach in and take it out-figuratively speaking, of

course. As an example, to determine the total cost of a $12.00

purchase, plus the sales tax, you might write a line like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

total = 12 + tax;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In this line, the word <TT>total</TT> is yet another variable.

After the computer performs the requested calculation, the variable

<TT>total</TT> will contain the sum of 12 and whatever value is

stored in <TT>tax</TT>. For example, if the value 0.72 is stored

in <TT>tax</TT>, after the calculation, <TT>total</TT> would be

equal to 12.72.

<P>

Do you see another place where a variable is necessary? How about

the hard-coded value 12? Such a hard-coded value makes a program

pretty useless because every person that comes into your store

to buy something isn't going to spend exactly $12.00. Because

the amount of each customer's purchase will change, the value

used in your sales tax calculation must change, too. That means

you need another variable. How about creating a variable named

<TT>purchase</TT>? With such a variable, you can rewrite the calculations

like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

tax = purchase * SALESTAX;

total = purchase + tax;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Now you can see how valuable variables can be. Every value in

the preceding lines is represented by a variable. (Although you're

using <TT>SALESTAX</TT> as a symbolic constant, because of Java's

current lack of true constants, it's really a variable, too.)

All you have to do to get the total to charge your customer is

plug the cost of his purchase into the variable <TT>purchase</TT>,

something you'll see how to do in <A HREF="ch6.html" >Chapter 6</A> &quot;Simple Input

and Output.&quot;

<P>

Math-savvy readers may have already figured that the preceding

two lines can be easily simplified into one, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

total = purchase + (purchase * SALESTAX);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This revised line of code, however, is not as easy to understand

as the original two lines were. In programming, you must constantly

decide between longer, simpler code and shorter, more complex

code. I tend to go for the longer, easy-to-understand approach,

except when the longer code might bog down the program.

<H2><A NAME="NamingConstantsandVariables"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Naming Constants and Variables</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The first computer languages were developed by mathematicians.

For that reason, the calculations and the variables used in those

calculations were modeled after the types of equations mathematicians

were already accustomed to working with. For example, in the old

days, the lines in your tax program might have looked like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

a = b * c;

d = b + a;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

As you can see, this type of variable-naming convention left a

lot to be desired. It's virtually impossible to tell what type

of calculations are being performed. In order to understand their

own programs, programmers had to use tons of comments mixed in

with their source code so they could remember what the heck they

were doing from one programming session to the next. Such a section

of source code in Java might look like Listing 5.1.

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Listing 5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;LST5_1.TXT: An Example of Mathematician's

Variables.<BR>

</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

// Calculate the amount of sales tax.

a = b * c;



// Add the sales tax to the purchase amount.

d = b + a;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

Although adding comments to the program lines helps a little,

the code is still pretty confusing, because you don't really know

what the variables <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, <TT>c</TT>, and <TT>d</TT>

stand for. After a while (probably when mathematicians weren't

the only programmers), someone came up with the idea of allowing

more than one character in a variable name, which would enable

the programmer to create mathematical expressions that read more

like English. Thus, the confusing example above would be written

as Listing 5.2.

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Listing 5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;LST5_2.TXT: Using English-like Variable

Names.<BR>

</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

// Calculate the amount of sales tax.

tax = purchase * SALESTAX;



// Add the sales tax to the purchase amount.

total = purchase + tax;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

By using carefully chosen variable names, you can make your programs

self documenting, which means that the program lines themselves

tell whoever might be reading the program what the program does.

If you strip away the comments from the preceding example, you

can still see what calculations are being performed.

<P>

Of course, there are rules for choosing constant and variable

names (also known as identifiers because they identify a program

object). You can't just type a bunch of characters on your keyboard

and expect Java to accept them. First, every Java identifier must

begin with one of these characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A-Z<BR>

a-z<BR>

_ <BR>

$

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The preceding characters are any uppercase letter from <TT>A</TT>

through <TT>Z</TT>, any lowercase letter from <TT>a</TT> through

<TT>z</TT>, an underscore, and the dollar sign.

<P>

Following the first character, the rest of the identifier can

use any of these characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A-Z<BR>

a-z<BR>

_ <BR>

$<BR>

0-9

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

As you may have noticed, this second set of characters is very

similar to the first. In fact, the only difference is the addition

of the digits from <TT>0</TT> through <TT>9</TT>.

Java identifiers can also use Unicode characters above the hexadecimal value of 00C0. If you don't know about Unicode characters, don't panic; you won't be using them in this book. Briefly put, Unicode characters expand the symbols that can be used in a 
character set to include characters that are not part of the English language.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Suppose that you're now ready to write a program that calculates

the total number of parking spaces left in a parking garage. You

know that the total number of spaces in the garage is 100. You

further know that the vehicles in the garage are classified as

cars, trucks, and vans. The first step is to determine which values

would be good candidates for constants. Because a constant should

represent a value that's not likely to change from one program

run to another, the number of vehicles that the garage can hold

would make a good constant. Thinking hard (someone smell wood

burning?), you come up with an identifier of <TT>TOTALSPACES</TT>

for this value. In Java, the constant's definition looks like

this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

final int TOTALSPACES = 100;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In this line, the keyword <TT>int</TT> represents the data type,

which is integer. You should be able to understand the rest of

the line.

<P>

Now, you need to come up with the mathematical formula that'll

give you the answer you want. First, you know that the total number

of vehicles in the garage is equal to the sum of the number of

cars, trucks, and vans in the garage. Stating the problem in this

way not only clarifies what form the calculation must take, but

also suggests a set of good identifiers for your program. Those

identifiers are <TT>cars</TT>, <TT>trucks</TT>, <TT>vans</TT>,

and <TT>total_vehicles</TT>. So, in Java, your first calculation

looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

total_vehicles = cars + trucks + vans;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The next step is to subtract the total number of vehicles from

the total number of spaces that the garage holds. For this calculation,

you need only one new identifier to represent the remaining spaces,

which is the result of the calculation. Again, stating the problem

leads to the variable name, which might be <TT>remaining_spaces</TT>.

The final calculation then looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

remaining_spaces = TOTALSPACES - total_vehicles;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="DataTypes"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Data Types</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In attempting to give you a quick introduction to constants and

variables, the preceding sections skipped over a very important

attribute of all constants and variables: data type. You may remember

my mentioning two data types already, these being floating point

(represented by the <TT>float</TT> keyword) and integer (represented

by the <TT>int</TT> keyword). Java has eight different data types,

all of which represent different kinds of values in a program.

These data types are <TT>byte</TT>, <TT>short</TT>, <TT>int</TT>,

<TT>long</TT>, <TT>float</TT>, <TT>double</TT>, <TT>char</TT>,

and <TT>boolean</TT>. In this section, you'll learn what kinds

of values these various data types represent.

<H3><A NAME="IntegerValues">

Integer Values</A></H3>

<P>

The most common values used in computer programs are integers,

which represent whole number values such as 12, 1988, and -34.

Integer values can be both positive or negative, or even the value

0. The size of the value that's allowed depends on the integer

data type you choose. Java features four integer data types, which

are <TT>byte</TT>, <TT>short</TT>, <TT>int</TT>, and <TT>long</TT>.

Although some computer languages allow both signed and unsigned

integer values, all of Java's integers are signed, which means

they can be positive or negative. (Unsigned values, which Java

does not support, can hold only positive numbers.)

<P>

The first integer type, <TT>byte</TT>, takes up the least amount

of space in a computer's memory. When you declare a constant or

variable as <TT>byte</TT>, you are limited to values in the range

-128 to 127. Why would you want to limit the size of a value in

this way? Because the smaller the data type, the faster the computer

can manipulate it. For example, your computer can move a <TT>byte</TT>

value, which consumes only eight bits of memory, much faster than

an <TT>int</TT> value, which, in Java, is four times as large.

<P>

In Java, you declare a <TT>byte</TT> value like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

byte identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the preceding line, <TT>byte</TT> is the data type for the

value, and identifier is the variable's name. You can also simultaneously

declare and assign a value to a variable like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

byte count = 100;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

After Java executes the preceding line, your program will have

a variable named <TT>count</TT> that currently holds the value

of 100. Of course, you can change the contents of <TT>count</TT>

at any time in your program. It only starts off holding the value

100.

<P>

The next biggest type of Java integer is <TT>short</TT>. A variable

declared as <TT>short</TT> can hold a value from -32,768 to 32,767.

You declare a <TT>short</TT> value like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

short identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

short identifier = value;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the preceding line, value can be any value from -32,768 to

32,767, as described previously. In Java, <TT>short</TT> values

are twice as big in memory-16 bits (or two bytes)-as <TT>byte</TT>

values.

<P>

Next in the integer data types is <TT>int</TT>, which can hold

a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Now you're getting

into some big numbers! The <TT>int</TT> data type can hold such

large numbers because it takes up 32 bits (four bytes) of computer

memory. You declare <TT>int</TT> values like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

int identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

int identifier = value;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The final integer data type in the Java language is <TT>long</TT>,

which takes up a whopping 64 bits (eight bytes) of computer memory

and can hold truly immense numbers. Unless you're calculating

the number of molecules in the universe, you don't even have to

know how big a <TT>long</TT> number can be. I'd figure it out

for you, but I've never seen a calculator that can handle numbers

that big. You declare a <TT>long</TT> value like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

long identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

long identifier = value;<BR>

How do you know which integer data type to use in your program? Choose the smallest data type that can hold the largest numbers you'll be manipulating. Following this rule keeps your programs running as fast as possible. However, having said that, I 
should tell you that most programmers (including me) use the <TT>int</TT> data type a lot, even when they can get away with a <TT>byte</TT>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="FloatingPointValues">

Floating-Point Values</A></H3>

<P>

Whereas integer values can hold only whole numbers, the floating-point

data types can hold  values with both whole number and fractional

parts. Examples of floating-point values include 32.9, 123.284,

and -43.436. As you can see, just like integers, floating-point

values can be either positive or negative.

<P>

Java includes two floating-point types, which are <TT>float</TT>

and <TT>double</TT>. Each type allows greater precision in calculations.

What does this mean? Floating-point numbers can become very complex

when they're used in calculations, particularly in multiplication

and division. For example, when you divide 3.9 by 2.7, you get

1.44444444. In actuality, though, the fractional portion of the

number goes on forever. That is, if you were to continue the division

calculation, you'd discover that you keep getting more and more

fours in the fractional part of the answer. The answer to 3.9

divided by 2.7 is not really 1.44444444, but rather something

more like 1.4444444444444444. But even that answer isn't completely

accurate. A more accurate answer would be 1.44444444444444444444444444444444.

The more 4s you add to the answer the more accurate the answer

becomes-yet, because the 4s extend on into infinity, you can never

arrive at a completely accurate answer.

<P>

Dealing with floating-point values frequently means deciding how

many decimal places in the answer is accurate enough. That's where

the difference between the <TT>float</TT> and <TT>double</TT>

data types shows up. In Java, a value declared as <TT>float</TT>

can hold a number in the range from around -3.402823 x 10 38 to

around 3.402823 x 10 38. These types of values are also known

as single-precision floating-point numbers and take up 32 bits

(four bytes) of memory. You declare a single-precision floating-point

number like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

float identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

float identifier = value;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the second line, value must be a value in the range given in

the previous paragraph, followed by an upper- or lowercase <TT>F</TT>.

However, you can write floating-point numbers in a couple of ways,

using regular digits and a decimal point or using scientific notation.

This value is the type of floating-point number you're used to

seeing:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

356.552

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Now, here's the same number written using Java's rules, in both

the number's normal form and in the form of scientific notation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

356.552f<BR>

3.56552e2f

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Both of the preceding values are equivalent, and you can use either

form in a Java program. The <TT>e2</TT> in the second example

is the equivalent of writing <TT>x 102</TT> and is a short form

of scientific notation that's often used in programming languages.



<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If you're not familiar with scientific notation, the value 3.402823 x 10 38 is equal to 3.402823 times a number that starts with a 1 and is followed by 38 zeroes. Computer languages shorten this scientific notation to 3.402823e38.</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

The second type of floating-point data, <TT>double</TT>, represents

a double-precision value, which is a much more accurate representation

of floating-point numbers because it allows for more decimal places.

A <TT>double</TT> value can be in the range from -1.79769313486232

x 10 308 to 1.79769313486232 x 10 308 and is declared like this:

<PRE>

double identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

double identifier = value;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Floating-point values of the <TT>double</TT> type are written

exactly as their <TT>float</TT> counterparts, except you use an

upper- or lowercase <TT>D</TT> as the suffix, rather than an <TT>F</TT>.

Here's a few examples:

When using floating-point numbers in your programs, the same rule that you learned about integers applies: Use the smallest data type you can. This is especially true for floating-point numbers, which are notorious for slowing computer programs to a 
crawl. Unless you're doing highly precise programming, such as 3-D modeling, the single-precision <TT>float</TT> data type should do just fine.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="CharacterValues">

Character Values</A></H3>

<P>

Often in your programs, you'll need a way to represent character

values rather than just numbers. A character is a symbol that's

used in text. The most obvious examples of characters are the

letters of the alphabet, in both upper- and lowercase varieties.

There are, however, many other characters, including not only

things such as spaces, exclamation points, and commas, but also

tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds. The symbols 0 through

9 are also characters when they're not being used in mathematical

calculations.

<P>

In order to provide storage for character values, Java features

the <TT>char</TT> data type, which is 16 bits. However, the size

of the <TT>char</TT> data type has little to do with the values

it can hold. Basically, you can think of a <TT>char</TT> as being

able to hold a single character. (The 16 bit length accommodates

Unicode characters, which you don't need to worry about in this

book.) You declare a <TT>char</TT> value like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

char c;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

char c = 'A';

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the second example, you're not only declaring the variable

<TT>c</TT> as a <TT>char</TT>, but also setting its value to an

uppercase A. Notice that the character that's being assigned is

enclosed in single quotes.

<P>

Some characters cannot be written with only a single symbol. For

example, the tab character is represented in Java as <TT>\t</TT>,

which is a backslash followed by a lowercase <TT>t</TT>. There

are several of these special characters, as shown in Table 5.1.

Although the special characters in Table 5.1 are represented by

two symbols, the first of which is always a backslash, you still

use them as single characters. For example, to define a <TT>char</TT>

variable as a backspace character, you might write something like

the following in your Java program:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

char backspace = '\b';

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

When Java's compiler sees the backslash, it knows that it's about

to encounter a special character of some type. The symbol following

the backslash tells the compiler which special character to use.

Because the backslash is used to signify a special character,

when you want to specify the backslash character yourself, you

must use two backslashes, which keeps the compiler from getting

confused. Other special characters that might confuse the compiler

because they are used as part of the Java language are single

and double quotes. When you want to use these characters in your

program's data, you must also precede them with a backslash.

<H3><A NAME="BooleanValues">

Boolean Values</A></H3>

<P>

Many times in a program, you need a way to determine if a specific

condition has been met. For example, you might need to know whether

a part of your program executed properly. In such cases, you can

use Boolean values, which are represented in Java by the <TT>boolean</TT>

data type. Boolean values are unique in that they can be only

one of two possible values: true or false. You declare a <TT>boolean</TT>

value like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

boolean identifier;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

or

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

boolean identifier = value;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the second example, value must be <TT>true</TT> or <TT>false</TT>.

In an actual program, you might write something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

boolean file_okay = true;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Boolean values are often used in <TT>if</TT> statements, which

enable you to do different things depending on the value of a

variable. You'll learn about <TT>if</TT> statements in Chapter

9, &quot;The <TT>if</TT> and <TT>switch</TT> Statements.&quot;

<P>

Table 5.2 summarizes Java's various data types. Take some time

now to look over the table and make sure you understand how the

data types differ from each other. You might also want to think

of ways you might use each data type in an actual program.<BR>

Variable Scope</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

When you write your Java programs, you can't just declare your

variables willy-nilly all over the place. You first have to consider

how and where you need to use the variables. This is because variables

have an attribute known as scope, which determines where in your

program variables can be accessed. In Java, a variable's scope

is determined by the program block in which the variable first

appears. The variable is &quot;visible&quot; to the program only

from the beginning of its program block to the end of the program

block. When a program's execution leaves a block, all the variables

in the block disappear, a phenomenon that programmers call &quot;going

out of scope.&quot;

<P>

Now you're probably wondering, &quot;What the devil is a program

block?&quot; Generally, a program block is a section of program

code that starts with an opening curly brace ({) and ends with

a closing curly brace (}). (Sometimes, the beginning and ending

of a block are not explicitly defined, but you don't have to worry

about that just yet.) Specifically, program blocks include things

like classes, functions, and loops, all of which you'll learn

about later in this book.

<P>

Of course, things aren't quite as simple as all that (you're dealing

with computers, after all). The truth is that you can have program

blocks within other program blocks. When you have one block inside

another, the inner block is considered to be nested. Figure 5.1

illustrates the concept of nested program blocks.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f5-1.gif"><B> Figure 5.1 : </B><I>Program blocks can be nested inside other program blocks.



</I></A><P>

<P>

In the figure, Block 1 encloses both Block 2 and Block 3. That

is, Block 2 and Block 3 are nested within Block 1, because these

blocks occur after Block 1's opening brace but before Block 1's

closing brace. If you wanted, you could also create a Block 4

and nest it within Block 2 or Block 3, and thus create even another

level of nesting. As you'll see when you start writing full-length

Java programming, all programs have a lot of nesting going on.

<P>

The ability to nest program blocks adds a wrinkle to the idea

of variable scope. Because a variable remains in scope from the

beginning of its block to the end of its block, such a variable

is also in scope in any blocks that are nested in the variable's

block. For example, looking back at Figure 5.1, a variable that's

defined in Block 1 is accessible in not just Block 1, but also

in Block 2 and Block 3. However, a variable defined inside Block

2 is accessible only in Block 2, because such a variable goes

into scope at the start of Block 2 and goes out of scope at the

end of Block 2. If you're a little confused, the following example

ought to clear things up.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleDeterminingaVariablesScope">

Example: Determining a Variable's Scope</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose you've written the small Java program shown in Listing

5.3. (Nevermind, at this point, that you don't know much about

writing Java programs. Such minor details will be remedied by

the time you complete this book.) The program shown in the listing

follows the same program structure as that shown in Figure 5.1.

That is, there is one large main block that contains two nested

blocks. The main block begins with the opening brace on the second

line and ends with the closing brace at the end of the program.

The first inner block begins with the opening brace after the

line labeling <TT>Function1</TT> and ends with the closing brace

three lines below the opening brace. The second inner block is

defined similarly, with its own opening and closing braces.

<P>

Now look at the variables being used in this program. The first

variable defined in the program is <TT>value1</TT>, which is found

right after the main block's opening brace. This means that <TT>value1</TT>

is accessible in all three blocks, as you can see by looking at

the <TT>Block2</TT> and <TT>Block3</TT> blocks, both of which

assign new values to <TT>value1</TT>.

<P>

The second variable in the program, <TT>value2</TT>, is defined

inside the <TT>Block2</TT> block, where it's both declared and

assigned the value 4.5f. In the <TT>Block3</TT> block, the program

tries to assign a value to <TT>value2</TT>. If you tried to compile

this program, you'd see that this line creates an error message,

as shown in Figure 5.2. In the figure, the compiler is insisting

that <TT>value2</TT> in the <TT>Block3</TT> block is undefined,

which, of course, is true as far as the <TT>Block3</TT> block

is concerned. You'd get a similar message if you tried to access

<TT>value2</TT> anywhere but within the scope of the <TT>Block2</TT>

block.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f5-2.gif"><B> Figure 5.2 : </B><I>When you try to access a variable that's out of scope, Java's compiler thinks that the variable is undefined.



</I></A><P>

<P>

You can use variable scope to simplify the access of variables

in a program. For example, you will usually declare variables

that you need in many places, so that they are in scope in the

entire class. That way, you can access the variables without having

to pass them as arguments to functions. (If you don't know about

argument passing just yet, you will after you read <A HREF="ch12.html" >Chapter 12</A>,

&quot;Functions.&quot;) On the other hand, you'll have lots of

variables that you use only inside one particular program block.

You can keep your program uncluttered by being sure to declare

these types of variables only in the blocks in which they're used.

You'll learn more about setting up variables with the proper scope

as you write Java programs later in this book.

All computers must manipulate data in order to produce output.

Java, like all programming languages, features many data types

that you can use for constants and variables in your programs.

These data types enable you to store everything from simple integers

like 23 and -10 to strings and complex floating-point numbers.

There's a lot to know about variables, so your head may be spinning

a bit at this point. Rest assured, however, that once you start

writing programs and using variables, all the theoretical stuff

will make sense.
