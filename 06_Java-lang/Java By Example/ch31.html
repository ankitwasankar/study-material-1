<P>

When using Windows 95 (and other modern operating systems), you

know that you can run several programs simultaneously. This ability

is called multitasking. What you may not know is that many of

today's operating systems also allow threads, which are separate

processes that are kind of a step down from a complete application.

A thread is a lot like a subprogram. An applet can create several

threads-several different flows of execution-and run them concurrently.

This is a lot like having multitasking inside multitasking. The

user knows that he or she can run several applications at a time.

The programmer knows that each application can run several threads

at a time. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create and manage

threads in your own applets.

<H2><A NAME="TwoKindsofThreads"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Two Kinds of Threads</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In Java, you can create threads in a couple of ways. The simplest

way is to take an existing class and turn it into a thread. You

do this by modifying the class so that it implements the <TT>Runnable</TT>

interface, which declares the <TT>run()</TT> method required by

all types of threads. (The <TT>run()</TT>method contains the code

to be executed by a thread.) In the previous chapter, you learned

how interfaces in Java enable you to add capabilities to classes

simply by implementing the interface in that class. Now, you get

a chance to put that idea to work for real.

<P>

The second way to create a thread is to write a completely separate

class derived from Java's <TT>Thread</TT> class. Because the <TT>Thread</TT>

class itself implements the <TT>Runnable</TT> interface, it already

contains a <TT>run()</TT> method. However, <TT>Thread</TT>'s <TT>run()</TT>

method doesn't do anything. You usually have to override the method

in your own class in order to create the type of thread you want.

<H2><A NAME="ConvertingaClasstoaThread"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Converting a Class to a Thread</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

As I mentioned in the preceding section, the first way to create

a thread is to convert a class to a thread. To do this, you must

perform several steps, as listed here:

<OL>

<LI>Declare the class as implementing the <TT>Runnable</TT> interface.

<LI>Implement the <TT>run()</TT> method.

<LI>Declare a <TT>Thread</TT> object as a data field of the class.

<LI>Create the <TT>Thread</TT> object and call its <TT>start()</TT>

method.

<LI>Call the thread's <TT>stop()</TT> method to destroy the thread.

</OL>

<P>

The following sections look at each of these steps in detail.

<H3><A NAME="DeclaringtheClassasImplementingtheIRunnableIInterface">

Declaring the Class as Implementing the <I>Runnable</I> Interface

</A></H3>

<P>

As you can see in step 1 in the preceding section, to create a

thread from a regular class, the class must first be declared

as implementing the <TT>Runnable</TT> interface. For example,

if your class is declared as

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

public class MyApplet extends Applet 

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

you must change that declaration to

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

public class MyApplet extends Applet 

    implements Runnable

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ImplementingtheIrunIMethod">

Implementing the <I>run()</I> Method</A></H3>

<P>

Now, because you've told Java you're about to implement an interface,

you must implement every method in the interface. In the case

of <TT>Runnable</TT>, that's easy because there's only one method,

<TT>run()</TT>, the basic implementation of which looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

public void run()

{

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

When you start your new thread, Java calls the thread's <TT>run()</TT>

method, so it is in <TT>run()</TT> where all the action takes

place. The preceding example of the <TT>run()</TT> method is the

minimum you need to compile the new source code for the thread.

However, in a real program, you'll add code to <TT>run()</TT>

so that the thread does what you want it to do.

<H3><A NAME="DeclaringaIThreadIObject">

Declaring a <I>Thread</I> Object</A></H3>

<P>

The next step is to declare a <TT>Thread</TT> object as a data

field of the class, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Thread thread;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The <TT>thread</TT> object will hold a reference to the thread

with which the applet is associated. You will be able to access

the thread's methods through this object.

<H3><A NAME="CreatingandStartingtheIThreadIObject">

Creating and Starting the <I>Thread</I> Object</A></H3>

<P>

Now it's time to write the code that creates the thread and gets

it going. Assuming that your new threaded class is an applet,

you'll often want to create and start the thread in the applet's

<TT>start()</TT> method, as shown in Listing 31.1.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Back in <A HREF="ch15.html" >Chapter 15</A>, &quot;Writing a Simple Applet,&quot; you learned that <TT>start()</TT> is the method that represents the applet's second life-cycle stage. Java calls your applet's life-cycle methods in this order: 
<TT>init()</TT>, <TT>start()</TT>, <TT>paint()</TT>, <TT>stop()</TT>, and <TT>destroy()</TT>. Java calls the <TT>start()</TT> method whenever the applet needs to start running, usually when it's first loaded or when the user has switched back to the applet 
from another Web page.

<P>

Look at the call to the <TT>Thread</TT> constructor in Listing

31.1. Notice that the constructor's single argument is the applet's

<TT>this</TT> reference. This is how Java knows with which class

to associate the thread. Right after the call to the constructor,

the applet calls the <TT>Thread</TT> object's <TT>start()</TT>

method, which starts the thread running. When the thread starts

running, Java calls the thread's <TT>run()</TT> method, where

the thread's work gets done.

<H3><A NAME="StoppingtheThread">

Stopping the Thread</A></H3>

<P>

When the thread's <TT>run()</TT> method ends, so does the thread.

However, because threads tend to run for quite a while, controlling

things like animation in the applet, the user is likely to switch

away from your applet before the thread stops. In this case. it's

up to your applet to stop the thread. Because Java calls an applet's

<TT>stop()</TT> method whenever the user switches away from the

applet, the <TT>stop()</TT> method is a good place to stop the

thread, as shown in Listing 31.2.

<P>

To understand about threads, you really have to dig in and use

them. So in this section, you'll put together an applet that associates

itself with a <TT>Thread</TT> object and runs the thread to control

a very simple animated display. The animation in this case is

not a bunch of space invaders landing to take over the earth,

but rather only a changing number that proves that the thread

is running. Listing 31.3 is the applet in question, which is called

ThreadApplet. Figure 31.1 shows the applet running under Appletviewer.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

There are a couple of interesting things in ThreadApplet of which

you should be aware. First, notice that in <TT>run()</TT>, the

thread loops one thousand times, after which the <TT>while</TT>

loop ends. When the <TT>while</TT> loop ends, so does the <TT>run()</TT>

method. This means that when you run ThreadApplet, if you let

it count all the way to one thousand, the thread ends on its own.

However, what if you switch to a different Web page before ThreadApplet

has counted all the way to one thousand? Then, Java calls the

applet's <TT>stop()</TT> method, which ends the thread by calling

the thread's <TT>stop()</TT> method.

<P>

The next point of interest is what's going on inside <TT>run()</TT>.

At the beginning of the loop, the program increments the counter,

converts the counter's value to a string, and then repaints the

applet so that the new count value appears in the window. That

code should be as clear as glass to you by now. But what's all

that malarkey after the call to <TT>repaint()</TT>? That's where

the thread not only times the animation, but also relinquishes

the computer so that other threads get a chance to run. Simply,

the call to the thread's <TT>sleep()</TT> method suspends the

thread for the number of milliseconds given as its single argument.

In this case, the sleep time is 100 milliseconds, or one tenth

of a second. If you want the animation to run faster, change the

100 to a smaller value. To count slower, change the 100 to a larger

value.

It's important that your threads not dominate the computer's processor for longer than necessary. This is because other threads and processes are almost certainly in competition for the processor at the same time. If your thread will be running for a 
while, you should call the <TT>sleep()</TT> or <TT>yield() </TT>methods in order to give other processes a chance to run. This is more important on some systems than on others, but since you can't know for sure which system your applet will be running on, 
be a considerate thread programmer.

<P>

Notice that the call to <TT>sleep()</TT> is enclosed in a <TT>try</TT>

block and followed by a <TT>catch</TT> block that's watching for

<TT>InterruptedException</TT> exceptions. You have to catch this

exception because the <TT>sleep()</TT> method throws it. If you

fail to catch the exception, your program will not compile.

<H2><A NAME="DerivingaClassfromIThreadI"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Deriving a Class from <I>Thread</I></FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The second way to create a thread is to derive a new class from

<TT>Thread</TT>. Then, in your applet's class, you create and

start a thread object of your thread class. This leaves you with

two processes going simultaneously, the applet and the thread

object created in the class. By giving the thread class access

to data and methods in the applet, the thread can easily communicate

with the applet in order to perform whatever tasks it was written

for.

Suppose that you want to write the same sort of applet as that

shown in Listing 31.3, but now you want a separate thread to control

the counting process. Listing 31.4 shows how you might write the

new class for the thread. (Don't try to compile this code yet.

You'll use it in the next example in this chapter.)

<P>

The first thing to notice in this thread class is that its constructor

takes as a single argument a reference to a <TT>ThreadApplet2</TT>

object, which is the applet from which you'll be running this

thread. The thread needs this reference so that it can communicate

with the applet.

<P>

Next, look at <TT>run()</TT>. The thread still counts from zero

to one thousand, but now it accesses the applet object in order

to create the display string and repaint the applet. In the original

version of the program, the thread was directly associated with

the class, rather than a completely separate process.

<P>

Now that you have a new thread class, you'll want to call it up

for active duty. You'll do that in the next example.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingaSeparateThreadinanApplet">

Example: Using a Separate Thread in an Applet</A></H3>

<P>

You'll now put that new thread class to work. To do this, you

must have an applet that creates an object from the new thread

class and calls that object's <TT>start()</TT> method to get the

thread running. Listing 31.5 shows just such an applet, called

ThreadApplet2. When you run the applet under Appletviewer, you'll

see the same display that was created in the original version

of the applet (ThreadApplet), but now the counting animation is

being controlled by a separate thread class.

<H2><A NAME="SynchronizingMultipleThreads"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Synchronizing Multiple Threads</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

There may be times when you have several threads going, each competing

for the same resources. This type of resource competition can

be deadly for threads. For example, what if one thread tries to

read from a string while another thread is still writing to that

string? Depending on the situation, you'll get strange results.

You can avoid these problems by telling Java where synchronization

problems may occur so that Java can keep an eye out for unhealthy

thread competition.

<P>

To put Java on guard, you use the <TT>synchronized</TT> keyword

when you define a method (or even a code block). When you mark

a method as synchronized, Java creates a monitor object for the

class. The first time a thread calls the synchronized method,

Java gives the monitor object to that thread. As long as the thread

holds the monitor object, no other thread can enter the synchronized

section of code. You can think of the monitor object as a key.

Unless a thread is holding the key, it can't unlock the door to

the synchronized method.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingaSynchronizedMethod">

Example: Using a Synchronized Method</A></H3>

<P>

Using synchronized methods makes sense only when more than one

thread is vying for an applet's resources. For that reason, to

demonstrate thread synchronization, you need to create two threads.

Listing 31.6 is a thread class, called MyThread2, that can count

either forward or backward, depending upon the values you give

to the class's constructor. By creating two thread objects from

this class, you can experiment with thread synchronization.

<P>

When you construct a <TT>MyThread2</TT> thread object, you must

pass two values as parameters: a reference to the applet and a

<TT>boolean</TT> value indicating whether the thread should count

forward or backward. The thread uses the <TT>boolean</TT> value

in its <TT>InitCounter()</TT> method to set the values needed

to accomplish the counting. These values are the starting count

value (<TT>count</TT>), the counting increment (<TT>increment</TT>),

the target count (<TT>end</TT>), and the position at which to

display the count in the applet (<TT>position</TT>). Notice that

the <TT>increment</TT> variable can be either 1 or -1. When the

increment gets added to the count, a positive <TT>increment</TT>

increases the count by one, whereas a negative <TT>increment</TT>

decreases the count by one.

<P>

In its <TT>run()</TT> method, the thread calls the applet's <TT>SetDisplayStr()</TT>

method, which, as you'll soon see, is the synchronized method.

In other words, if the thread isn't holding the monitor object

for <TT>SetDisplayStr()</TT>, it cannot enter the method. This

prevents two running instances of the <TT>MyThread2</TT> thread

from trying to change the display string at the same time.

<P>

Now it's time to look at the applet that's in charge of the threads.

Listing 31.7 is the applet, which is called ThreadApplet3. This

applet creates two objects of the <TT>MyThread2</TT> class: one

that counts forward and one that counts backward. The applet's

<TT>SetDisplayStr()</TT> method is where the synchronization comes

into play because both threads will be trying to access this method.

<P>

When you run the applet, you'll see that when the first thread

can display its count, the string will appear closer to the top

of the display area. The second thread, however, displays its

count below the first thread's. For this reason, when you get

the applet going, you can sit back and watch the two threads battle

over the <TT>SetDisplayStr()</TT> method.

<P>

The ThreadApplet3 applet is unique with regards to other applets

in this book because it's the only applet that takes full advantage

of the applet's life-cycle stages. In the <TT>init()</TT> method,

the applet creates the two threads. The different <TT>boolean</TT>

values given as the constructor's second argument cause the first

thread to count forward and the second thread to count backward.

<P>

In the <TT>start()</TT> method, the applet calls each thread's

<TT>isAlive()</TT> method to determine whether the thread has

been started yet. The first time <TT>start()</TT> gets called,

the threads have been created in <TT>init()</TT> but haven't been

started. In this case, <TT>isAlive()</TT> returns <TT>false</TT>,

and the applet calls each thread's <TT>start()</TT> method to

get the threads rolling. If <TT>start()</TT> is not being called

for the first time, it's because the user has switched back to

the applet from another Web page. In this case, <TT>isAlive()</TT>

returns <TT>true</TT>. The applet knows that it must call the

threads' <TT>resume()</TT> method rather than <TT>start()</TT>.

<P>

In the <TT>stop()</TT> method, which gets called when the user

switches to another Web page, rather than stopping the threads,

the applet suspends them. The threads remain suspended until the

applet calls their <TT>resume()</TT> methods, which, as you now

know, happens in the <TT>start()</TT> method.

<P>

Finally, when Java calls the <TT>destroy()</TT> method, the applet

is going away for good. The threads, too, should follow suit,

so the applet calls each thread's <TT>stop()</TT> method.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When programming threads, you always have to watch out for a condition known as <I>deadlock</I>. Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting to gain control of a resource, but for one reason or another, the threads rely on conditions that can't 
be met in order to get control of the resource. To understand this situation, imagine that you have a pencil in your hand, and someone else has a pen. Now, assume that you can't release the pencil until you have the pen, and the other person can't release 
the pen until she has the pencil. Deadlock! A more computer-oriented example would be when one thread must access Method1 before it can release its hold on Method2, but the second thread must access Method2 before it can release its hold on Method1. 
Because these are mutually exclusive conditions, the threads are deadlocked and cannot run.

Threads enable you to break an applet's tasks into separate flows

of execution. These subprograms seem to run concurrently thanks

to the task switching that occurs in multitasking systems. You

can create a thread from a class by implementing the <TT>Runnable</TT>

interface in the class. However, you can also create a separate

class for your threads by deriving the class from <TT>Thread</TT>.

Depending on how you want to use the threads, you can create and

start your threads in the applet's <TT>start()</TT> method and

stop the threads in the <TT>stop()</TT> method. If you want your

threads to retain their state when the user switches to and from

your Web page, you should create the threads in <TT>init()</TT>,

start or resume the threads in <TT>start()</TT>, suspend the threads

in <TT>stop()</TT>, and stop the threads in <TT>destroy()</TT>.

Remember that if there's a chance that two or more threads may

compete for a resource, you need to protect that resource using

thread synchronization.

<LI>Modify the ThreadApplet2 applet so that the thread changes

the color of three rectangles displayed in the applet (see Figure

and blue. Repeat the color cycling until the user stops the applet.

<LI>Modify your ThreadApplet5 applet (naming the new applet ThreadApplet6)

so that it runs two threads. One thread should change the rectangles'

colors to red, green, and blue, and the second thread should change

the rectangles to pink, orange, and yellow. Modify the <TT>ColorThread</TT>

class from exercise 2, renaming it <TT>ColorThread2</TT>, and

then create a new thread class called <TT>ColorThread3</TT> for

setting the second set of colors. Don't forget to use thread synchronization

to prevent one thread from changing the rectangles' colors when

another thread is already doing so. (You can find the solution

for this exercise in the CHAP31 folder of this book's CD-ROM.)
