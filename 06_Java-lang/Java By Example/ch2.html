<P>

Because you're interested in writing Java applets (you bought

this book, after all), you're probably already pretty familiar

with using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create Web pages.

If not, you should pick up a book on HTML and get some idea of

how that markup language works. Even if you're an HTML expert,

though, you may not have seen the HTML extension that Sun Microsystems

created to support Java applets in Web pages. In this chapter,

then, you not only get a chance to see Java applets up and running,

but you also learn how to add them to your Web pages.

<H2><A NAME="TheSampleJavaApplets"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

The Sample Java Applets</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

As you learned in <A HREF="ch1.html" >Chapter 1</A> &quot;Java Overview,&quot; the Java

Developer's Kit (JDK) includes many sample applets that you can

test in your Web pages. (The HotJava browser, too, comes with

a few of these sample applets.) If you installed the JDK as described

in <A HREF="ch1.html" >Chapter 1</A> you're ready to start experimenting with Java applets.

In this section, you will use the Appletviewer tool-which comes

with the JDK-to get a quick look at some applets. A following

section, &quot;Adding Applets to an HTML Document,&quot; will

show you how to add an applet to a Web page.

<H3><A NAME="TheAppletviewerTool">

The Appletviewer Tool</A></H3>

<P>

The truth is that you can write and run applets without even having

a Java-compatible browser. This is thanks to the Appletviewer

tool that comes as part of the JDK. Appletviewer is a Windows

application (unless you're using a non-Windows version of the

JDK) that you run from a DOS command line. Part of the command

line is the applet that you want to run. When Appletviewer appears,

the applet appears in the viewer's main window.

<P>

To run the Appletviewer application, first bring up an MS-DOS

window by selecting the MS-DOS Prompt command from Programs on

the Start menu. Then, switch to the folder containing the applet

you want to run and type the command line<TT> C:\JAVA\BIN\APPLETVIEWER

DOC.htmlL</TT>.

<P>

In the preceding command line, DOC.htmlL is the name of an HTML

document that contains the tag for the applet you want to see.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleRunningTicTacToe">

Example: Running TicTacToe</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose you want to run the TicTacToe demo applet that comes with

the JDK. To do this, just follow these steps:

<OL>

<LI>Select the Start/Programs/MS-DOS Prompt command. The DOS window

appears, as shown in Figure 2.1.<BR>

<IMG SRC="f2-1.gif"><B> Figure 2.1 : </B><I>The first step <r>in running Appletviewer is <r>to bring up the MS-DOS window.



</I></A><P>

<LI>Change to the directory containing the TicTacToe applet (Figure

2.2).<BR>

<IMG SRC="f2-2.gif"><B> Figure 2.2 : </B><I>The second step is to change to the applet's directory.



</I></A><P>

<LI>Type the command line <TT>C:\JAVA\BIN\APPLETVIEWER EXAMPLE1.htmlL.</TT>The

Appletviewer runs, loading and displaying the TicTacToe applet

(Figure 2.3).<BR>

<IMG SRC="f2-3.gif"><B> Figure 2.3 : </B><I>The requested applet appears in Appletviewer's main window.



</I></A><P>

</OL>

<P>

Now that you have the applet started, try a few games of TicTacToe

against the computer. To place an X, click the square you want.

You'll quickly discover that the computer player is as dumb as

yogurt. Let's just say that you don't have to be a rocket scientist

to win (Figure 2.4).

If you want to avoid typing the full path name for Appletviewer every time you run it, type the command <TT>PATH=C:\JAVA\BIN </TT>at the MS-DOS prompt to add Appletviewer's directory to your path. (Of course, if you've installed the JDK somewhere else on 
your hard drive, you'll have to use a different path in the command.) After you type this command, MS-DOS will be able to find Appletviewer without your having to type the full path. For example, you'll be able to run TicTacToe by switching to the 
TicTacToe directory and simply typing <TT>APPLETVIEWER EXAMPLE1.htmlL</TT>. You can also add Appletviewer's path to the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and thus avoid having to type it in by hand every time you start your system and want to use 
Appletviewer.

<H3><A NAME="TheAnimatorApplet">

The Animator Applet</A></H3>

<P>

Another applet that demonstrates some interesting facets of Java

programming is the Animator applet, which not only displays various

animation sequences, but also plays sound effects simultaneously.

To run the Animator applet, switch to the C:\JAVA\DEMO\ANIMATOR

folder and type the command line <TT>APPLETVIEWER EXAMPLE1.htmlL</TT>.

(The previous command line assumes that you've set your path to

the JAVA\BIN directory.) When you do, you see the display shown

in Figure 2.5. (Yep, it's the ubiquitous Duke, waving at you from

his very own applet.)

<P>

<IMG SRC="f2-5.gif"><B> Figure 2.5 : </B><I>The Animator applet includes several animation and sound examples, including this one featuring Duke, the Java mascot.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Animator is an example of a configurable applet. That is, by modifying

the HTML tag that loads and runs the applet, the user can display

his or her own custom animation sequence and sound effects. You'll

learn about configurable applets in <A HREF="ch26.html" >Chapter 26</A>, &quot;Configurable

Applets.&quot; For now, though, it's enough for you to know that

Java is capable of adding both animation sequences and sound effects

to your Web pages.

<H3><A NAME="TheBarChartApplet">

The BarChart Applet</A></H3>

<P>

BarChart, another configurable applet, is especially useful when

you need to graphically display data values in a Web page. To

check out BarChart, switch to the JAVA\DEMO\BARCHART folder and

type the command line <TT>APPLETVIEWER EXAMPLE1.htmlL</TT>. When

you do, you see the window shown in Figure 2.6.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f2-6.gif"><B> Figure 2.6 : </B><I>The BarChart applet enables you to create graphs in your Web pages.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Because BarChart is configurable, you can create all sorts of

different bar charts in your Web pages just by specifying different

parameters in the applet's HTML tag. As you can see, applets can

be powerful tools for creating dynamic and useful Web pages. (Try

out Appletviewer's Applet,Tag command to see the code that specifies

how the bar chart appears.)

<H3><A NAME="OtherDemoApplets">

Other Demo Applets</A></H3>

<P>

The DEMO folder contains many sample applets that you can experiment

with using Appletviewer. All of the demo applets are run from

HTML documents with names such as EXAMPLE1.htmlL, EXAMPLE2.htmlL,

and so on. All demo applets have at least the EXAMPLE1.htmlL document,

while others have additional examples. To run any demo applet,

change to the applet's folder and type <TT>APPLETVIEWER EXAMPLE1.htmlL</TT>

(assuming that you've set your path to the Appletviewer application).

Use the <TT>DIR </TT>command to display the contents of an applet's

directory in order to discover whether the applet features additional

example HTML files.

Adding Applets to an HTML Document</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

If you've created Web pages before, you know that you use HTML

to create a template for the page. The commands in the template

tell a Web browser how to display the Web page. When Sun Microsystems

developed Java, they also had to come up with an extension to

HTML that would enable Web pages to contain Java applets. That

extension is the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag, which Sun Microsystems

defines as shown in Listing 2.1.

<P>

In the preceding tag, the text in normal characters is typed literally;

the text shown in italics is replaced by whatever is appropriate

for the applet you're including in the document. As you can see,

the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag is similar to other HTML tags

with which you may be familiar. For example, the tag starts with

<TT>&lt;applet attributes&gt;</TT> and ends with <TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT>,

which is not unlike the format of other HTML tags. The first and

last lines are required. Other lines in the tag are optional.

<P>

The attributes section of the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag contains

important information about the tag, including the associated

.CLASS file and the applet's width and height. The last line tells

the browser that it has reached the end of the tag. You can load

and run the TicTacToe applet, for example, with the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>

tag shown in Listing 2.2.

<P>

In the preceding example, the <TT>code</TT> attribute is the name

of the .CLASS file for the applet. If you remember, the .CLASS

file holds the applet's byte-code representation, which can be

run by the Java interpreter. The <TT>width</TT> and <TT>height</TT>

attributes control the size of the applet.

<P>

The TicTacToe tag above is the simplest <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>

tag you can write. That is, the <TT>code</TT>, <TT>width</TT>,

and <TT>height</TT> attributes are all required, as is the final

<TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT> line.

<H3><A NAME="OptionalAttributesforApplets">

Optional Attributes for Applets</A></H3>

<P>

There are several optional attributes you can use with the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>

tag. The first is <TT>codebase</TT>, which specifies the applet's

base folder or URL (Uniform Resource Locator). This folder or

URL is used in combination with the file specified in the <TT>code</TT>

attribute to find the applet's code. In the case of a folder,

the <TT>codebase</TT> attribute is relative to the location of

the HTML document containing the applet's tag. In Listing 2.2,

because the <TT>codebase</TT> attribute is missing, the Web browser

will look for the applet's files in the same folder as the HTML

document. The <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag in Listing 2.2 looks

like Listing 2.3 when using the <TT>codebase</TT> attribute. (Don't

try to use run this HTML code, as it's only an example of the

attribute's format and may not run.)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

The preceding tag tells the browser that the TicTacToe.class file

is located in a folder called TICTACTOE. This folder must be on

the same level in the directory tree as the HTML file. That is,

if the HTML file is in the folder JAVA\DEMO, then the path for

the .CLASS file should be JAVA\DEMO\TICTACTOE\TicTacToe.class.

You can also use an URL, such as <TT><A HREF="http://www.provider.com/my_pages/tictactoe">http://www.provider.com/my_pages/tictactoe</A></TT>,

for the <TT>codebase</TT> attribute. This causes the applet to

be loaded from the specified site.

<P>

Other optional attributes you can use with the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>

tag are <TT>alt</TT>, <TT>align</TT>, <TT>name</TT>, <TT>hspace</TT>,

and <TT>vspace</TT>. The <TT>alt</TT> attribute enables you to

specify text that will be displayed by text-only browsers, whereas

the <TT>name</TT> attribute gives the applet a symbolic name that's

used to reference the applet (used when you need to communicate

between applets).

<P>

The <TT>align</TT>, <TT>hspace</TT>, and <TT>vspace</TT> attributes

all work together to position the applet within the text flow

of the HTML document. These attributes work exactly as they do

with the <TT>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag that's used to display images

in Web pages. The <TT>align</TT> attribute can be one of these

values: <TT>left</TT>, <TT>right</TT>, <TT>middle</TT>, <TT>absmiddle</TT>,

<TT>bottom</TT>, <TT>absbottom</TT>, <TT>baseline</TT>, <TT>top</TT>,

or <TT>texttop</TT>. The <TT>hspace</TT> and <TT>vspace</TT> attributes

control the amount of white space around the applet when <TT>align</TT>

is set to <TT>left</TT> or <TT>right</TT>.

Applet Parameters</A></H3>

<P>

As you know, many Java applets are configurable, meaning that

the applet user can specify certain values that the applet will

use when it starts. A good example is the BarChart applet you

saw earlier in this chapter. When you need to specify parameters

for an applet, you use the <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag. The <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT>

tags, one for each parameter you want to set, are placed after

the starting <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag and before the ending

<TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT> tag. For example, Listing 2.5 shows parameters

being set for the BarChart applet. Figure 2.8 shows the resultant

bar chart. As you can see from the listing, each parameter has

two parts, the parameter name and the value to which it should

be set. You'll learn more about applet parameters in <A HREF="ch26.html" >Chapter 26</A>,

&quot;Configurable Applets.&quot;

<P>

You may wonder what happens when a browser that's not Java-compatible

finds an applet in an HTML document. In this case, as is standard

behavior for browsers, the non-Java browser simply ignores the

tags it doesn't recognize. However, you may want to provide a

more user-friendly response to users who are trying to view your

applets with non-Java browsers. You can do this easily by placing

alternate content right before the ending <TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT>

tag. Listing 2.6, for example, shows the HTML script for running

the TicTacToe applet with alternate content for browsers that

don't support Java.

In the previous section, you saw a sample HTML document that contains

an applet. You also saw what this document looks like when loaded

into Netscape Navigator 2.0. Now you'll use what you've learned

to create your own &quot;appletized&quot; home page for Netscape

Navigator. To do this, you must first write your home page's HTML

file. Then you must set Netscape Navigator's home-page property,

which determines the document the browser displays at startup.

As you learned in this chapter, Java applets are relatively easy

to add to your HTML documents. However, folks without Web browsers

aren't completely left out of the fun. They can create and view

applets using the handy Appletviewer application that comes as

part of the JDK. Because HTML was designed long before there were

Java applets, Sun Microsystems had to create an extension to HTML

in order to accommodate applets in Web pages. The extension takes

the form of the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag, which enables you

to not only provide values for an applet's attributes, but also

to include a list of parameters and even offer alternate content

for non-Java browsers.
