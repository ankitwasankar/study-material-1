<P>

If you've seen a lot of the applets that are floating around,

you've undoubtedly noticed that many of them feature vivid graphics

and even sound effects. When programming in a language such a

C++, displaying graphics and playing sounds can be infamously

difficult, thanks to the fact that these languages provide no

direct support for handling these types of files. Even the Windows

API, as immense as it is, provides little help when it comes to

handling these graphical and aural chores. Java, on the other

hand, was designed to make creating applets as easy as possible.

For that reason, Java's classes handle almost all the difficulties

associated with displaying images (commonly called bitmaps) and

playing sounds. In this chapter, you use Java's power to add images

and sounds to your applets.

<H2><A NAME="ImageTypes"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Image Types</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In the world of computers, there are many types of images, each

of which is associated with a specific file format. These image

types are usually identified by their file extensions, which include

PCX, BMP, GIF, JPEG (or JPG), TIFF (or TIF), TGA, and more. Each

of these file types was created by third-party software companies

for use with their products, but many became popular enough to

grow into standards. The PCX graphics file type, for example,

began as the format for PC Paintbrush files, whereas BMP files

are usually associated with the Windows graphical interface.

<P>

If you were writing your Internet applications using a more conventional

language like C++, you could choose to support whatever image

type was most convenient for your use. This is because you'd have

to write all the file-loading code from scratch, anyway. Java,

on the other hand, comes complete with classes that are capable

of loading image files for you. This convenience comes with a

small price, however, since Java can load only GIF and JPEG image

file formats. In this book, you'll use GIF files, which are more

common, although JPEG files are rapidly gaining a reputation,

especially for high-resolution, true-color images.

<H2><A NAME="LoadingandDisplayinganImage"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Loading and Displaying an Image</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The first step in displaying an image in your applet is to load

the image from disk. To do this, you must create an object of

Java's <TT>Image</TT> class. This is fairly easy to do; however,

in order to do so, you need to create an <TT>URL</TT> object that

holds the location of the graphics file. You could just type the

image's URL directly into your Java source code. If you do this,

however, you have to change and recompile the applet whenever

you move the graphics file to a different directory on your disk.

A better way to create the image's <TT>URL</TT> object is to call

either the <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT> or <TT>getCodeBase()</TT>

method. The former returns the URL of the directory from which

the current HTML file was loaded, whereas the latter returns the

URL of the directory from which the applet was run.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingtheIgetDocumentBaseIMethod">

Example: Using the <I>getDocumentBase()</I> Method</A></H3>

<P>

As I said previously, the <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT> method returns

the URL of the directory from which the HTML document was loaded.

If you're storing your images in the same directory (or a subdirectory

of that directory) as your HTML files, you'd want to use this

method to obtain an URL for an image.

<P>

Suppose you have your HTML documents in a directory called PUBLIC

and the image you want, called IMAGE.gif, is stored in a subdirectory

of PUBLIC called IMAGES. A call to <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT>

will get you the appropriate base URL. That call looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

URL url = getDocumentBase();

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

As you'll soon see, once you have the URL, you can load the file

by using the URL along with the relative location of the image,

which in this case would be IMAGES/IMAGE.gif. The full URL to

the file would then be FILE:/C:/PUBLIC/IMAGES/IMAGE.gif. If you

decided to move your public files to a directory called MYHOMEPAGE,

the call to <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT> will give you the URL for

that new directory, without your having to change the applet's

source code. This new URL, once you included the relative location

of the image file, would be FILE:/C:/MYHOMEPAGE/IMAGES/IMAGE.gif.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingtheIgetCodeBaseIMethod">

Example: Using the <I>getCodeBase()</I> Method</A></H3>

<P>

The <TT>getCodeBase()</TT> method works similarly to <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT>,

except that it returns the URL of the directory from which the

applet was loaded. If you're storing your images in the same directory

(or a subdirectory of that directory) as your CLASS files, you'd

want to call <TT>getCodeBase()</TT> to obtain an URL for an image.

<P>

Suppose you have your CLASS files in a directory called CLASSES

and the image you want (still called IMAGE.gif) is stored in a

subdirectory of CLASSES called IMAGES. A call to <TT>getCodeBase()</TT>

will get you the base URL you need to load the image. That call

looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

URL url = getCodeBase();

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Again, once you have the URL, you can load the file by using the

URL along with the relative location of the image, which would

still be IMAGES/IMAGE.gif. The full URL to the file would then

be FILE:/C:/CLASSES/IMAGES/IMAGE.gif.

<H3><A NAME="LoadinganImage">

Loading an Image</A></H3>

<P>

Once you have the image's base URL, you're ready to load the image

and create the <TT>Image</TT> object. You can complete both of

these tasks at the same time, by calling your applet's <TT>getImage()</TT>

method, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Image image = getImage(baseURL, relLocation);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The <TT>getImage()</TT> method's two arguments are the URL returned

by your call to <TT>getCodeBase()</TT> or <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT>

and the relative location of the image. For example, assuming

that you've stored your CLASS files in the directory C:\CLASSES

and your images in the directory C:\CLASSES\IMAGES, you'd have

a code that looks something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

URL codeBase = getCodeBase();

Image myImage = getImage(codeBase, &quot;images/myimage.gif&quot;);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

After Java has executed the above lines, your image is loaded

into the computer's memory and ready to display.

<H3><A NAME="DisplayinganImage">

Displaying an Image</A></H3>

<P>

Displaying the image is a simple matter of calling the <TT>Graphics</TT>

object's <TT>drawImage()</TT> method, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

g.drawImage(myImage, x, y, width, height, this);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This method's arguments are the image object to display, the X

and Y coordinates at which to display the image, the width and

height of the image, and the applet's <TT>this</TT> reference.



<P>

<CENTER>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>TIP</B></TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When you want to display an image with its normal width and height, you can call a simpler version of the <TT>drawImage()</TT> method, which leaves out the width and height arguments, like this: <TT>drawImage(image, x, y, this)</TT>. This version of the 
method actually draws the image faster because it doesn't have to worry about reducing or expanding the image to the given width and height. It just blasts it on to the screen exactly as the image normally appears.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

You may be wondering where you can get the width and the height

of the image. As it turns out (no doubt thanks to careful consideration

by Java's programmers over hundreds of cups of coffee), the <TT>Image</TT>

class has two methods, <TT>getWidth()</TT> and <TT>getHeight()</TT>,

that return the width and height of the image. The complete code

for displaying the image, then, might look like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

int width = image.getWidth(this);

int height = image.getHeight(this);

g.drawImage(image, x, y, width, height, this);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

As you can see, the <TT>getWidth()</TT> and <TT>getHeight()</TT>

methods require a single argument, which is the applet's <TT>this</TT>

reference.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleDisplayinganImageinanApplet">

Example: Displaying an Image in an Applet</A></H3>

<P>

You're now ready to write an applet that can display images. Listing

27.1 is the Java source code for an applet called ImageApplet

that displays a small image using the techniques described previously

in this chapter. When you run the applet with Appletviewer, you

see the window shown in Figure 27.1. Make sure the SNAKE.gif image

is in the same directory as the ImageApplet.class file, since

that's where the program expects to find it.

By using different values for the <TT>drawImage()</TT> method's width and height arguments, you can display an image at any size you like. For example, to display an image at twice its normal size, just use <TT>2*width</TT> and <TT>2*height</TT> for the 
width and height arguments. To display the image at half its normal size, use <TT>width/2</TT> and <TT>height/2</TT>. Figure 27.2 shows the snake image displayed at twice its normal size. It doesn't even fit in the window any more!

Playing a Sound</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Just as there are many types of image files, so too are there

many types of sound files. But, when it comes to applets, the

only type of sound file you need to know about are audio files,

which have the file extension AU. These types of sound files were

popularized on UNIX machines and are the only type of sound file

Java can load and play.

<P>

When you want to play a sound from beginning to end, you only

have to call <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT> or <TT>getCodeBase()</TT>

for the URL and then call <TT>play()</TT> to play the sound. A

call to <TT>play()</TT> looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

play(baseURL, relLocation);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The <TT>play()</TT> method's two arguments are the URL returned

from a call to <TT>getDocumentBase()</TT> or <TT>getCodeBase()</TT>

and the relative location of the sound file.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingtheIplayIMethod">

Example: Using the <I>play()</I> Method</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose you have your CLASS files in the directory C:/MYHOMEPAGE

and your AU files in the directory C:/MYHOMEPAGE/AUDIO. The following

lines then will load and play an audio file called SOUND.AU:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

play(codeBase, &quot;audio/sound.au&quot;);

Now get ready to write an applet that plays a sound file. Listing

27.2 is the applet in question, called SoundApplet. When you run

the applet with Appletviewer, you'll see the window shown in Figure

27.3. Just click the button to hear the sound. Of course, you

need to have a sound card properly installed on your system. You

also must be sure that the SPACEMUSIC.AU sound file is in the

same directory as the applet. (This sound file is included with

the Java Developer's Kit and has been copied to this chapter's

CD-ROM directory for your convenience.)

<H3><A NAME="ControllingSounds">

Controlling Sounds</A></H3>

<P>

Although the applet's <TT>play()</TT> method is the easiest way

to load and play sounds, it doesn't give you much control. You

have only one option: play the sound from beginning to end. If

you want a little more control over your sounds, you can create

an <TT>AudioClip</TT> object and use the object's methods to control

the sound. Unfortunately, even the <TT>AudioClip</TT> class doesn't

give you much power, although you can play, stop, and loop the

sound.

<P>

To create the <TT>AudioClip</TT> object, you call the <TT>getAudioClip()</TT>

method, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

AudioClip audioClip = getAudioClip(baseURL, relLocation);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This method's two arguments are the sound file's base URL and

relative location.

<P>

Once you have the <TT>AudioClip</TT> object created and loaded,

you can call its methods to control the sound. There are only

three from which to choose: <TT>play()</TT>, <TT>stop()</TT>,

and <TT>loop()</TT>. The <TT>play()</TT> method plays the sound

once from beginning to end, <TT>stop()</TT> stops the sound whether

or not it has finished playing, and <TT>loop()</TT> causes the

sound to keep repeating until it's stopped.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsinganAudioClipinanApplet">

Example: Using an AudioClip in an Applet</A></H3>

<P>

Although using audio clips is a little more complicated than simply

loading and playing a sound using the applet's <TT>play()</TT>

method, it's still a straightforward process. Listing 27.3 is

an applet that creates an <TT>AudioClip</TT> object and enables

the user to send commands to the object using the applet's command

buttons. When you run the applet with Appletviewer, you see the

window shown in Figure 27.4. To play the sound once from beginning

to end, click the Play button. To stop the sound at any time,

click the Stop button. Finally, to play the sound over and over,

click the Loop button.

Summary</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Nothing spices up an applet more than vivid graphics and enjoyable

sound effects. That's why Java's creators went to such lengths

to ensure that you can easily add these important elements to

your applets. Loading and displaying an image is as simple as

obtaining the image's base URL, creating an <TT>Image</TT> object,

and calling <TT>drawImage()</TT> to display the image on the screen.

Sound effects are just as easy-if not easier-to handle. The simplest

way is to call the applet's <TT>play()</TT> method, which will

play the sound from beginning to end. However, if you want a little

extra control over the sound, you can create an <TT>AudioClip</TT>

object, whose method's enable you to play, stop, and loop the

sound.
