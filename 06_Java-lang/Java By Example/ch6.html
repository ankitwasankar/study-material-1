<P>

In the previous chapter, you learned how you can store various

types of values in your Java programs. It may have occurred to

you that it doesn't do much good to store data in a computer's

memory if you have no way of actually seeing that data. Also,

you need a way to request and receive data from users of your

programs. Both of these tasks-displaying and retrieving data-are

accomplished through simple input and output, or I/O (as it's

commonly called). In this chapter, you'll learn how Java enables

you to perform simple I/O in your applets.

<H2><A NAME="WindowsandGraphics"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Windows and Graphics</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Because you'll be writing your applets for a graphical user interface

(GUI) such as Windows, you can't use the same kinds of data input/output

that you may have been accustomed to using under another operating

system, such as MS-DOS. This is because, under a system such as

Windows, everything that appears on the screen is graphical (unlike

MS-DOS, which displays plain old text).

<P>

Still, displaying graphical text doesn't require a whole lot of

work, as long as you're not concerned with things like fonts and

the size of the text string you want to display. You have to remember,

though, that almost all graphical text is proportional, meaning

that each letter in a line of graphical text takes up a different

amount of space. Under an operating system like MS-DOS, most text

output uses non-proportional characters. The difference is illustrated

in Figure 6.1.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f6-1.gif"><B> Figure 6.1 : </B><I>In a proportional font, each character takes <r>up only as much space as it needs.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Look at the letter &quot;I&quot; in the proportional font. You

can see that it takes up much less space than other letters in

the word. On the other hand, the letter &quot;I&quot; in the non-proportional

font, as well as the hyphen, takes up exactly the same amount

of space as every other letter.

<P>

The point is that, because of the different fonts that are used

to print text in a graphical user interface, you can't assume

much about the size of the text that'll be used. There are ways

to figure out the actual size of a text string, but you don't

have to be concerned with these details for now. Just be aware

that text output in your applets is going to be graphical.

<H2><A NAME="DisplayingTextinanApplet"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Displaying Text in an Applet</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The easiest thing to display is a line of text. But because the

text output will be graphical, you need to use one of Java's graphical-text

functions. The most commonly used is <TT>drawString()</TT>, which

is part of the <TT>Graphics</TT> class contained in the <TT>awt</TT>

package. Listing 6.1 shows a simple applet that uses this method

to display a single line of text. Figure 6.1 shows what the applet

looks like when viewed with the Appletviewer application. Finally,

Listing 6.2 is an HTML document that tests the Applet1 applet.

<P>

In the next section, you'll see exactly how the Applet1 applet

works. But before you get too much farther, you need to know how

to create and run the many applets that you'll find in this book.

All the applets that follow use the same sort of procedure. This

procedure involves creating the applet's source code, compiling

the code, and then writing the HTML document that demonstrates

the applet. Follow the steps below to get the Applet1 applet up

on your screen.

<OL>

<LI>Create a folder called CLASSES on the root directory of your

hard drive.

<LI>Type Listing 6.1 and save it in the CLASSES folder as an ASCII

file. Name the file <TT>Applet1.java</TT>. (Use uppercase and

lowercase letters exactly as shown for the program's file name.)

Note that you can also copy the listing from this book's CD-ROM,

if you don't want to type it.

<LI>Start an MS-DOS session by selecting Start/Programs/MS-DOS

Prompt. If the MS-DOS screen takes over the entire screen, press

Alt+Enter to display the MS-DOS session in a window.

<LI>If you haven't added the JAVA\BIN path to your AUTOEXEC.BAT

file, type <TT>PATH=JAVA\BIN</TT> at the MS-DOS prompt. This ensures

that the system will be able to find Java's executables.

<LI>Type <TT>cd c:\classes</TT> to move to your CLASSES folder.

<LI>Type <TT>javac Applet1.java</TT> to compile the Applet1 applet.

You should receive no error messages, as shown in Figure 6.3.

If you do receive error messages, carefully check your typing

of Listing 6.1. Also, make sure you typed the command line <TT>javac

Applet1.java</TT> properly. When the compiler finishes, you'll

have the file <TT>Applet1.class</TT> in your CLASSES directory.

This is the applet's byte-code file.<BR>

<IMG SRC="f6-3.gif"><B> Figure 6.3 : </B><I>The Applet1.class file must compile with no errors.



</I></A><P>

<LI>Type Listing 6.2 and save it as an ASCII file to your CLASSES

folder. Name the file APPLET1.htmlL. (This time, the case of the

letters doesn't matter.)

<LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type <TT>appletviewer applet1.htmll</TT>

(case doesn't matter). When you do, Appletviewer will load and

display the applet.

Java insists that the name of a Java source-code file is the same name as the class contained in the file. If you try to use different names, even if the difference is only the case of a letter or two, the Java compiler will complain and refuse to compile 
the program.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="HowAppletWorks">

How Applet1 Works</A></H3>

<P>

By now, you have the source code for Applet1 properly typed and

compiled. You've even run the applet using Appletviewer. You know

that the call to the <TT>drawString()</TT> method prints a string

as graphical text in the applet's display area. But what are the

values between <TT>drawString()</TT>'s parentheses? And how does

the program know when to execute the call to <TT>drawString()</TT>?

<P>

First, look at the <TT>paint()</TT> method. Java calls <TT>paint()</TT>

whenever the applet's display area (or canvas, as it's often called)

needs to be redrawn. The <TT>paint()</TT> method always gets called

when the applet first appears on the screen, which is exactly

what's happening in Applet1. You run the applet, Java calls <TT>paint()</TT>

when the applet appears, and <TT>paint()</TT> calls <TT>drawString()</TT>,

which displays the text string &quot;Hello from Java.&quot;

<P>

<CENTER>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>NOTE</B></TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The Java compiler is case-sensitive, meaning that it can differentiate between upper- and lowercase letters. For this reason, you have to be extra careful to type method names properly. For example, if you type <TT>Paint()</TT> instead of 
<TT>paint()</TT>, Java will not recognize the method and will not call it when the applet needs to be redrawn.

</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

What's that &quot;g&quot; followed by a period in front of the

call to <TT>drawString()</TT>? Remember that I said <TT>drawString()</TT>

is a method of the <TT>Graphics</TT> class. If you look at the

first line of the <TT>paint()</TT> method, you'll see <TT>Graphics

g</TT> in the parentheses. This means that Java is sending an

object of the <TT>Graphics</TT> class to the <TT>paint()</TT>

method and that object is called <TT>g</TT>. Whenever you need

to call an object's method, you must preface the method's name

with the object's name followed by a period. So, the line

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

g.drawString(&quot;Hello from Java!&quot;, 60, 75);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

tells Java to call the <TT>g</TT> object's <TT>drawString()</TT>

method. The values in the parentheses are called arguments, which

are values that you need to send to the method. The arguments

in the above call to <TT>drawString()</TT> tell Java to draw the

text &quot;Hello from Java!&quot; at column 60 and row 75 of the

display area. (The position is measured in pixels, not characters.

A pixel is the smallest dot that can be displayed on the screen.)

To display the text at a different location, just change the second

and third arguments. For example, Figure 6.4 shows the text positioned

at 25,25.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f6-4.gif"><B> Figure 6.4 : </B><I>Here, Applet1 displays the text at position 25,25.

<H2><A NAME="GettingInputfromtheUser"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Getting Input from the User</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Again, because you are now programming in a graphical environment,

getting input from the user isn't as easy as just calling an input

command. You must first create an area of the screen in which

the user can type and edit his response to your request. There

are several ways to do this, but one of the easiest is to add

a control of the <TT>TextField</TT> class in your applet. A <TT>TextField</TT>

control is much like the edit boxes you see when using Windows.

You might, for example, see a number of edit controls in a dialog

box. Listing 4.3 shows how to include a <TT>TextField</TT> control

in your applet. Figure 6.5 shows the Applet2 applet in action.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

To run the Applet2 applet yourself, you'll need to type and save

the source code, naming it <TT>Applet2.java</TT>. (You can copy

the source code from the CD-ROM, if you like, and thus save on

typing. Of course, you won't learn as much that way.) Then compile

the source code (type <TT>javac Applet2.java</TT> at the MS-DOS

prompt), which gives you the <TT>Applet2.class</TT> file. Next,

create a new HTML document from the one shown in Listing 6.2,

changing all instances of Applet1 to Applet2. You can then run

Applet2 by typing <TT>appletviewer applet2.htmll</TT> at the DOS

prompt.

<H3><A NAME="HowAppletWorks1">

How Applet2 Works</A></H3>

<P>

Applet2 looks quite a bit different from Applet1. First, it declares

a data field named <TT>textField</TT> as an object of the <TT>TextField</TT>

class, which represents a control very much like a standard Windows

edit box. The program declares the control like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

TextField textField;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Notice that the <TT>textField</TT> object is declared just as

you would declare any other kind of data object such as an integer

or a floating-point value. Next, notice that, although the name

of the class and the name of the object are spelled identically,

the object's name starts with a lowercase letter. This makes all

the difference in the world to Java, which is a case-sensitive

language.

<P>

Another difference between Applet1 and Applet2 is that Applet2

has an <TT>init()</TT> method instead of <TT>paint()</TT>. The

<TT>Init()</TT> method is another of those methods that Java calls

automatically-in this case, as soon as you run the Applet2 applet.

Because Java calls <TT>init()</TT> almost immediately, it's a

great place to initialize the applet. (Guess that's why they called

it <TT>init()</TT>, huh?)

<P>

In Applet2, when <TT>init()</TT> gets called, <TT>textField</TT>

has already been declared as an object of the <TT>TextField</TT>

class, but <TT>textField</TT> hasn't yet been assigned a value.

The first line of code in <TT>init()</TT> creates the <TT>TextField</TT>

object and assigns it to <TT>textField</TT>, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

textField = new TextField(20);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

After Java executes this line, <TT>textField</TT> refers to an

actual <TT>TextField</TT> object. The value in the parentheses

is the width of the <TT>TextField</TT> control; the larger this

number, the wider the control. Keep in mind that a <TT>textField</TT>

control can hold more text than its width allows. If you type

past the end of the control's text box, the text scrolls horizontally.

<P>

The next step is to add the object to the applet's display area,

like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

add(textField);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The <TT>add()</TT> method's single argument is the control you

want to add to the applet.

<P>

After creating the control and adding it to the applet, the control

will automatically appear when Java draws the applet. You don't

need a <TT>paint()</TT> method to draw a control, because the

control can take care of itself.

<P>

Once the <TT>TextField</TT> control is on the screen, you can

type in it. First, click the control to give it the focus, then

type and edit to your heart's content.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleRetrievingtextfromaITextFieldIcontrol">

In the Applet2 applet, you can type all you like in the <TT>TextField</TT>

control, but how do you get the text out of the control and actually

do something with it? Follow the steps below to create Applet3,

<H3><A NAME="HowAppletWorks2">

How Applet3 Works</A></H3>

<P>

If you look at the Applet3 program code, you can see that you've

added a <TT>paint()</TT> method. This is where the text that the

user types into the <TT>TextField</TT> control gets displayed.

First, <TT>paint()</TT> extracts the text from the control, like

this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

String s = textField.getText();

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This line declares a variable called <TT>s</TT> to be an object

of the <TT>String</TT> class, and then it sets <TT>s</TT> equal

to the text string in the control. (The <TT>String</TT> class

is another of Java's built-in classes that you'll learn more about

later. For now, just know that this class represents text strings.)

You can see in this line that you're calling the <TT>textField</TT>

object's <TT>getText()</TT> method, because of the object and

method name separated by the dot. The <TT>getText()</TT> method

simply returns the text string that's stored in the <TT>textField</TT>

control.

<P>

Displaying the string is as easy as calling on your old friend

<TT>drawString()</TT>, as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

g.drawString(s, 40, 50);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

One big difference between Applet2 and Applet3 is the <TT>action()</TT>

method. Java calls this method whenever the user performs some

action with controls in the applet. In this case, the action that

<TT>action()</TT> responds to is the user's pressing Enter after

typing text. In Applet3, the <TT>action()</TT> method does nothing

more than call the applet's <TT>repaint()</TT> method, which tells

Java that you want to redraw the applet's display area. (You'll

learn more about using the <TT>action()</TT> method later in the

book.) This causes Java to call the <TT>paint()</TT> method, which

very neatly displays the control's string.

In the previous chapter, you learned to declare and define a number

of different variable types, including <TT>int</TT>, <TT>byte</TT>,

<TT>short</TT>, <TT>float</TT>, and other numerical values. The

problem with numerical values in a computer is that you can't

display them without first converting them to text strings. Luckily,

this task is pretty easy to perform. You need only call the <TT>String</TT>

class's <TT>valueOf()</TT> method, as shown in Listing 6.5. Figure

6.7 shows Appletviewer running Applet4.

to strings. The method's single argument is the value you want

to convert, which can be any of Java's numerical data types.

<P>

All computer programs must deal with some form of I/O. At the

very least, a program must be able to display information to the

user, as well as retrieve data from the user. Java has several

ways to handle this basic form of I/O, a couple of which you learned

in this chapter. As you dig deeper into the art of writing Java

applets, you'll see other ways to perform I/O.

<LI>Modify Applet1 so that it displays the text string &quot;Out

to lunch!&quot; at position 30, 50 in the applet's display area.

<LI>Modify Applet2 so that it displays a <TT>TextField</TT> control

half as wide as the one displayed in the original program.

<LI>Write an applet that displays the days of the week in a column

down the center of the applet's display area.

<LI>Using Applet3 as a model, write a new applet called NameApplet

that asks the user for her name and age and then prints the answers

in the applet's display area. The finished applet should look

like Figure 6.8. (This one's tough, so, if you get stumped, check

out the file NameApplet.java in the CHAP06 folder of this book's

CD-ROM. First try to solve the problem yourself, though.)<BR>
