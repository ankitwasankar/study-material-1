<P>

As you've learned by now, using variables makes your programs

flexible. Thanks to variables, you can conveniently store data

in your programs and retrieve it by name. You can also get input

from your program's user. The best thing about variables is that

they can constantly change value. (They're called variables, after

all, because they're variable.)

<P>

Until now, you've learned about various types of numerical variables,

including integers, long integers, floating-point, and double

floating-point variables. You also know about string variables,

which can hold text. Now that you have a good understanding of

these data types, it's time to explore one last data type-a handy

data structure called an array.

<H2><A NAME="AnIntroductiontoArrays"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

An Introduction to Arrays</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Often in your programs, you'll want to store many values that

are related in some way. Suppose you manage a bowling league,

and you want to keep track of each player's average. One way to

do this is to give each player a variable in your program, as

shown in Listing 13.1. Figure 13.1 shows the applet running under

Appletviewer.

<HR>

<P>

When you run Applet16, you can enter bowling scores into the three

boxes at the top of the applet's display area. After you enter

these averages, they're displayed on-screen as well as copied

into the three variables <TT>avg1</TT>, <TT>avg2</TT>, and <TT>avg3</TT>.

<P>

Nothing too tricky going on here, right?

<P>

Now examine the listing. Remember in <A HREF="ch10.html" >Chapter 10</A>, &quot;The <TT>while</TT>

and <TT>do-while</TT> Loops,&quot; when you learned to keep an

eye out for repetitive program code? How about all those calls

to <TT>getText()</TT>, <TT>drawString()</TT>, and <TT>valueOf()</TT>

in Listing 13.1? The only real difference between them is the

specific bowler's score that's being manipulated. If you could

find some way to make a loop out of this code, you could shorten

the program significantly. How about a <TT>for</TT> loop that

counts from 1 to 3?

<P>

But how can you use a loop when you're stuck with three different

variables? The answer is an array. An array is a variable that

can hold more than one value. When you first studied variables,

you learned that a variable is like a box in memory that holds

a single value. Now, if you take a bunch of these boxes and put

them together, what do you have? You have an array. For example,

to store the bowling averages for your three bowlers, you'd need

an array that can hold three values. You could call this array

<TT>avg</TT>. You can even create an array for a set of objects

like the <TT>TextField</TT> objects Applet16 uses to get bowling

scores from the user. You could call this array <TT>textField</TT>.

<P>

Now you have an array called <TT>avg</TT> that can hold three

bowling averages and an array called <TT>textField</TT> that can

hold three <TT>TextField</TT> objects. But how can you retrieve

each individual average or object from the array? You do this

by adding something called a subscript to the array's name. A

subscript (also called an index) is a number that identifies the

element of an array in which a value is stored. For example, to

refer to the first average in your <TT>avg</TT> array, you'd write

<TT>avg[0]</TT>. The subscript is the number in square brackets.

In this case, you're referring to the first average in the array

(array subscripts always start from zero.) To refer to the second

average, you'd write avg<TT>[1]</TT>. The third average is <TT>avg[2]</TT>.

<P>

If you're a little confused, look at Figure 13.2, which shows

how the <TT>avg[]</TT> array might look in memory. In this case,

the three bowling averages are 145, 192, and 160. The value of

<TT>avg[0]</TT> is 145, the value of <TT>avg[1]</TT> is 192, and

the value of <TT>avg[2]</TT> is 160.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f13-2.gif"><B> Figure 13.2 : </B><I>An array can hold many values of the same type.



</I></A><P>

<H3><A NAME="ExampleCreatinganArray">

Example: Creating an Array</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose that you need an array that can hold 30 floating-point

numbers. First, you'd declare the array like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

float numbers[];

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Another way to declare the array is to move the square brackets

to after the data type, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

float[] numbers;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

After declaring the array, you need to create it in memory. Java

lets you create arrays only using the <TT>new</TT> operator, like

this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

numbers = new float[30];

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The last step is to initialize the array, a task that you might

perform using a <TT>for</TT> loop:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

for (int x=0; x&lt;30; ++x)

    numbers[x] = (float)x;

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

These lines of Java source code initialize the <TT>numbers[]</TT>

array to the numbers 0.0 to 29.0. Notice how the loop only goes

up to 29. This is because, although there are 30 elements in the

<TT>numbers[]</TT> array, those elements are indexed starting

with 0, rather than 1. That is, the subscript is always one less

than the number of the element you're accessing. The first element

has a subscript of 0, the second a subscript of 1, the third a

subscript of 2, and so on.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingaVariableasaSubscript">

Example: Using a Variable as a Subscript</A></H3>

<P>

As you learned in a previous chapter, most numerical literals

in a Java program can be replaced by numerical variables. Suppose

you were to use the variable <TT>x</TT> as the subscript for the

array <TT>avg[]</TT>. Then (based on the averages in Figure 13.2)

if the value of <TT>x</TT> is 1, the value of avg[x] is 192. If

the value of <TT>x</TT> is 3, the value of <TT>avg[x]</TT> is

160.

<P>

Now take one last, gigantic, intuitive leap (c'mon, you can do

it) and think about using your subscript variable <TT>x</TT> as

both the control variable in a <TT>for</TT> loop and the subscript

for the <TT>avg[]</TT> and <TT>textField</TT> arrays. If you use

a <TT>for</TT> loop that counts from 0 to 2, you can handle all

three averages with much less code than in the original program.

Listing 13.2 shows how this is done.

<P>

At the beginning of Listing 13.2, you'll see a couple of strange

new variable declarations that look like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

TextField textField[];

int avg[];

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

These declarations are much like other declarations you've seen,

except both of the variable names end with a set of square brackets.

The square brackets tell Java that you're declaring arrays rather

than conventional variables.

<P>

Once you have the arrays declared, you must create them. In Applet17,

this is done like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

textField = new TextField[3];

avg = new int[3];

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Here you use the <TT>new</TT> operator to create the arrays. To

tell Java the type of arrays to create, you follow <TT>new</TT>

with the data type and the size of the array in square brackets.

In other words, the first line above creates an array that can

hold three <TT>TextField</TT> objects. The second line creates

an array that can hold three integers.

<P>

Once you have your arrays created, you can use a loop to reduce

the amount of code needed to initialize the arrays. For example,

the long way to initialize the arrays (without using a loop) would

look something like Listing 13.3:

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Listing 13.3&nbsp;&nbsp;LST13_3.TXT: Initializing an Array

without Looping.<BR>

</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

textField[0] = new TextField(5);

add(textField[0]);

textField[0].setText(&quot;0&quot;);

textField[1] = new TextField(5);

add(textField[1]);

textField[1].setText(&quot;0&quot;);

textField[2] = new TextField(5);

add(textField[2]);

textField[2].setText(&quot;0&quot;);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

As you learned, however, you can use a variable-specifically,

a loop control variable-as the array subscript. That's what Applet17

does, which enables it to initialize the <TT>textField</TT> array

as shown in Listing 13.4.

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Listing 13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;LST13_4.TXT: Initializing an Array

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

    textField[x] = new TextField(5);

    add(textField[x]);

    textField[x].setText(&quot;0&quot;);

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

The first time through the loop, <TT>x</TT> is equal to 0, so

that element 0 (the first element) of the <TT>textField</TT> array

is being manipulated. The next time through the loop, <TT>x</TT>

is 1, so that element 1 of the array is being manipulated in the

body of the loop. Finally, when <TT>x</TT> is 2, the program takes

care of the third array element. As you can see, using a loop

with an array can greatly simplify handling a group of related

values. Imagine how many lines of source code you'd save if the

array had 1,000 elements instead of only three. To accommodate

the larger array, you'd only have to change <TT>x&lt;3</TT> to

<TT>x&lt;1000</TT> in the first line of the <TT>for</TT> loop.

Be careful not to try accessing a nonexistent array element. For example, in Listing 13.4, if you tried to access <TT>textField[3]</TT>, you'd be beyond the boundaries of the array. Java will generate an exception when this happens, which means your 
applet may or may not perform the way you want it to. (You'll learn more about exceptions in <A HREF="ch30.html" >Chapter 30</A>, &quot;Exceptions.&quot;)

The <TT>init()</TT> method isn't the only place Applet17 takes

This loop simplifies the printing of the bowlers' scores and the

loading of the <TT>avg[]</TT> array with the scores. Again, imagine

those that you really learn to appreciate arrays.

The memory locations that make up an array are called <I>elements</I> of the array. For example, in an array named <TT>numbers[]</TT>, <TT>numbers[0]</TT> is the first element of the array, <TT>numbers[1]</TT> is the second element, and so on. The reason 
<TT>numbers[0]</TT> is the first element of the array is because of the number 0 inside the subscript.It is the number inside the subscript that defines which array location is being referred to.

<H2><A NAME="MultidimensionalArrays"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Multidimensional Arrays</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

So far, you've looked at simple arrays that hold their data in

a list. However, most programming languages also support multidimensional

arrays, which are more like tables than lists. For example, take

a look at Figure 13.3. The first array in the figure is a one-dimensional

array, which is like the arrays you've used so far in this chapter.

The next type of array in the figure is two-dimensional, which

works like the typical spreadsheet type of table you're used to

seeing.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f13-3.gif"><B> Figure 13.3 : </B><I>Arrays can have more than one dimension.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Although Java doesn't support multidimensional arrays in the conventional

sense, it does enable you to create arrays of arrays, which amount

to the same thing. For example, to create a two-dimensional array

of integers like the second array in Figure 13.3, you might use

a line of code like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

int table[][] = new int[4][4];

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This line of Java code creates a table that can store 16 values-four

across and four down. The first subscript selects the column and

the second selects the row. To initialize such an array with values,

you might use the lines shown in Listing 13.6, which would give

you the array shown in Figure 13.4.

You refer to a value stored in a two-dimensional array by using

subscripts for both the column and row in which the value you

want is stored. For example, to retrieve the value 11 from the

<TT>table[][]</TT> array shown in Figure 13.4, you use a line

like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

int value = table[3][2];

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

A quick way to initialize a two-dimensional array is to use nested

<TT>for</TT> loops, as shown in Listing 13.7.

    }

}

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>

If you've never seen nested loops before, you're about to discover

how handy they can be. In the case of Listing 13.7, the outside

loop (the <TT>x</TT> loop) starts first, setting <TT>x</TT> to

0. But the body of the loop is another loop. So the inside loop

(the <TT>y</TT> loop) starts, setting <TT>y</TT> to 0, which brings

the program to the line that initializes an element of the array.

Because <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> both equal 0, the array element

<TT>table[0][0]</TT> gets set to 5. Then the inside loop sets

<TT>y</TT> to 1, which means <TT>table[0][1]</TT> gets set to

5. When the inner loop finishes, the program branches back to

the outer loop, setting <TT>x</TT> to 1. The inner loop repeats

again, only this time with <TT>x</TT> equal to 1 and <TT>y</TT>

going from 0 to 2. Finally, when both loops finish, the entire

array is initialized.

<P>

Of course, to create the array shown in Figure 13.4 with loops,

you have to be a little more tricky, as shown in Listing 13.8.

Work through each loop to see how the array gets initialized.

To be sure you understand how arrays work, you'll put a two-dimensional

array to work in a program called Applet18. The Applet18 applet

creates and initializes a two-dimensional array with six columns

and eight rows. (Try to imagine the elements of this array as

the rows and columns of a spreadsheet.) The program then prints

the contents of the array in the Applet's display area, so you

can see that the array truly holds the values to which it was

initialized. Listing 13.9 is the program, whereas Figure 13.5

shows the applet running under the Appletviewer application.

Notice in <TT>init()</TT> and <TT>paint()</TT> how the nested

loops don't have curly braces like the example shown in Listing

13.8. This is because when you have only one statement in a program

block, the curly braces are optional. In Applet18's <TT>init()</TT>

method, the outside loop contains only one statement, which is

the inner <TT>for</TT> loop. The inner <TT>for</TT> loop also

contains only a single statement, which is the line that initializes

the currently indexed element of the array. In the <TT>paint()</TT>

method, the outer loop contains only one statement, which is the

inner <TT>for</TT> loop. However, the inner loop contains two

statements, so the curly braces are required in order to mark

off that program block.

Arrays are a powerful data structure that enable you to store

many related values using the same variable name. A one-dimensional

array is a lot like a list of values that you can access by telling

Java the appropriate subscript (or index). But because array subscripts

always start at 0, the subscript is always one less than the number

of the associated element. You can also create multidimensional

arrays (or, to be more precise, arrays of arrays). A two-dimensional

array is organized much like a table. To access the elements of

a two-dimensional array, you need two subscripts. The first subscript

identifies the column of the table and the second identifies the

row.

<OL>

<LI>Declare an array that can hold 50 integers.

<LI>Write the code that creates the array you declared in exercise

1.

<LI>Write a <TT>for</TT> loop that initializes the array to the

values 50 through 99.

<LI>Write the Java code to declare and create a two-dimensional

array with 10 columns and 15 rows.

<LI>Write nested <TT>for</TT> loops that initialize the array

from exercise 4 to the values 0 through 149.

<LI>Write the Java code needed to display, in table form, the

values in the array from exercise 5.

<LI>Modify Applet17 so that it stores and displays not only the

bowlers' scores, but also the bowlers' names. Create three <TT>TextField</TT>

objects to enable the user to enter names and three for entering

the scores. Name the program <TT>ScoreApplet.java</TT>. Figure

13.6 shows what the final applet should look like at startup.
