<P>

Anyone who's had anything to do with computers in the '90s knows

that the Internet is all the rage. The immense growth of this

global computer network has not only created a handy way to download

files and information but has also sparked major controversies

over freedom of speech, copyright law, and computer security.

Hardly a day goes by without the Internet making the news.

<P>

But not all Internet activity is steeped in controversy. One of

the more positive Internet newsmakers has been the release of

Java, a computer programming language that enables folks like

you and me to easily create applications that can be used across

the Internet without worrying about platform compatibility or

network security. The two types of Java applications-applets for

use within World Wide Web pages and stand-alone Java applications-are

guaranteed to do more to liven up the World Wide Web than even

the most heated controversy.

<P>

Java, however, was conceived long before its suitability for the

Internet was noted and taken advantage of. You may be surprised

to learn that Java was developed for a very different use. In

fact, &quot;Java&quot; isn't even the language's original name.

In this chapter, you'll get a quick look at Java's history, as

well as learn why Java is an excellent tool for creating Internet

applications.

<H2><A NAME="TheJavaStory"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

The Java Story</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Back in 1990, a gentleman by the name of James Gosling was given

the task of creating programs to control consumer electronics.

Gosling and his team of people at Sun Microsystems started designing

their software using C++, the language that most programmers were

praising as the next big thing because of its object-oriented

nature. Gosling, however, quickly found that C++ was not suitable

for the projects he and his team had in mind. They ran into trouble

with complicated aspects of C++ such as multiple inheritance of

classes and with program bugs such as memory leaks. Gosling soon

decided that he was going to have to come up with his own, simplified

computer language that would avoid all the problems he had with

C++.

<P>

Although Gosling didn't care for the complexity of languages such

as C++, he did like the basic syntax and object-oriented features

of the language. So when he sat down to design his new language,

he used C++ as its model, stripping away all the features of C++

that made that language difficult to use with his consumer-electronics

projects. When Gosling completed his language-design project,

he had a new programming language that he named Oak. (The story

goes that the name Oak came to Gosling as he gazed out his office

window at an oak tree.)

<P>

Oak was first used in something called the Green project, wherein

the development team attempted to design a control system for

use in the home. This control system would enable the user to

manipulate a list of devices, including TVs, VCRs, lights, and

telephones, all from a hand-held computer called *7 (Star Seven).

The *7 system featured a touch-sensitive screen that the owner

used to select and control the devices supported by the control.



<P>

The *7 screen display featured a number of animated figures, of which Duke (now the little guy considered to be the Java mascot) was one. Once you get involved with Java, you're liable to see a lot of Duke, who pops up on the Sun Microsystems Web site 
(Figure 1.1), and who is featured in some of Sun's sample Java applets.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

<IMG SRC="f1-1.gif"><B> Figure 1.1 : </B><I>Duke has become the Java mascot.



</I></A><P>

<P>

The next step for Oak was the video-on-demand (VOD) project, in

which the language was used as the basis for software that controlled

an interactive television system. Although neither *7 nor the

VOD project led to actual products, they gave Oak a chance to

develop and mature. By the time Sun discovered that the name &quot;Oak&quot;

was already claimed and they changed the name to Java, they had

a powerful, yet simple, language on their hands.

<P>

More importantly, Java was a platform-neutral language, which

meant that programs developed with Java could run on any computer

system with no changes. This platform independence was attained

by using a special format for compiled Java programs. This file

format, called byte-code, could be read and executed by any computer

system that has a Java interpreter. The Java interpreter, of course,

must be written specially for the system on which it will run.

<P>

In 1993, after the World Wide Web had transformed the text-based

Internet into a graphics-rich environment, the Java team realized

that the language they had developed would be perfect for Web

programming. The team came up with the concept of Web applets,

small programs that could be included in Web pages, and even went

so far as to create a complete Web browser (now called HotJava)

that demonstrated the language's power.

<P>

In the second quarter of 1995, Sun Microsystems officially announced

Java. The &quot;new&quot; language was quickly embraced as a powerful

tool for developing Internet applications. Netscape Communications,

the developer of the popular Netscape Navigator Web browser (Figure

1.2), added support for Java to its new Netscape Navigator 2.0.

Other Internet software developers are sure to follow suit, including

Microsoft, whose Internet Explorer 3 (currently in beta) offers

Java support. After more than five years of development, Java

has found its home.

<P>

</I></A><P>

<H2><A NAME="IntroducingJava"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Introducing Java</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

By now, you may be curious why Java is considered such a powerful

tool for Internet development projects. You already know that

Java is a simplified version of C++.  Anyone who has struggled

with learning C++ knows that the key word in the previous sentence

is &quot;simplified.&quot; C++ added so much to the C language

that even professional programmers often have difficulty making

the transition.

<P>

According to Sun Microsystems, Java is &quot;simple, object-oriented,

statically typed, compiled, architecture neutral, multi-threaded,

garbage collected, robust, secure, and extensible.&quot; That's

a mouthful, but this description of Java probably doesn't help

you understand the language much. The following list of Java's

attributes, however, should clear out some of the cobwebs:

<UL>

<LI>Simple. Java's developers deliberately left out many of the

unnecessary features of other high-level programming languages.

For example, Java does not support pointer math, implicit type

casting, structures or unions, operator overloading, templates,

header files, or multiple inheritance.

<LI>Object-oriented. Just like C++, Java uses classes to organize

code into logical modules. At runtime, a program creates objects

from the classes. Java classes can inherit from other classes,

but multiple inheritance, wherein a class inherits methods and

fields from more than one class, is not allowed.

<LI>Statically typed. All objects used in a program must be declared

before they are used. This enables the Java compiler to locate

and report type conflicts.

<LI>Compiled. Before you can run a program written in the Java

language, the program must be compiled by the Java compiler. The

compilation results in a &quot;byte-code&quot; file that, while

similar to a machine-code file, can be executed under any operating

system that has a Java interpreter. This interpreter reads in

the byte-code file and translates the byte-code commands into

machine-language commands that can be directly executed by the

machine that's running the Java program. You could say, then,

that Java is both a compiled and interpreted language.

<LI>Multi-threaded. Java programs can contain multiple threads

of execution, which enables programs to handle several tasks concurrently.

For example, a multi-threaded program can render an image on the

screen in one thread while continuing to accept keyboard input

from the user in the main thread. All applications have at least

one thread, which represents the program's main path of execution.

<LI>Garbage collected. Java programs do their own garbage collection,

which means that programs are not required to delete objects that

they allocate in memory. This relieves programmers of virtually

all memory-management problems.

<LI>Robust. Because the Java interpreter checks all system access

performed within a program, Java programs cannot crash the system.

Instead, when a serious error is discovered, Java programs create

an exception. This exception can be captured and managed by the

program without any risk of bringing down the system.

<LI>Secure. The Java system not only verifies all memory access

but also ensures that no viruses are hitching a ride with a running

applet. Because pointers are not supported by the Java language,

programs cannot gain access to areas of the system for which they

have no authorization.

<LI>Extensible. Java programs support native methods, which are

functions written in another language, usually C++. Support for

native methods enables programmers to write functions that may

execute faster than the equivalent functions written in Java.

Native methods are dynamically linked to the Java program; that

is, they are associated with the program at runtime. As the Java

language is further refined for speed, native methods will probably

be unnecessary.

<LI>Well-understood. The Java language is based upon technology

that's been developed over many years. For this reason, Java can

be quickly and easily understood by anyone with experience with

modern programming languages such as C++.

</UL>

<P>

As you can tell from the preceding list of features, a great deal

of thought went into creating a language that would be fairly

easy to use but still provide the most powerful features of a

modern language like C++. Thanks to features such as automatic

garbage collection, programmers can spend more time developing

their programs rather than wasting valuable man-hours hunting

for hard-to-find memory-allocation bugs. However, features such

as Java's object-oriented nature, as well as its ability to handle

multiple threads of execution, ensure that the language is both

up-to-date and powerful.

<H2><A NAME="JavaPrograms"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Java Programs</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

As I mentioned previously. Java can be used to create two types

of programs: applets and stand-alone applications. An Applet is

simply a part of a Web page, just as an image or a line of text

can be. Just as a browser takes care of displaying an image referenced

in an HTML document, a Java-enabled browser locates and runs an

Applet . When your Java-capable Web browser loads the HTML document,

the Java applet is also loaded and executed.

<P>

Using applets, you can do everything from adding animated graphics

to your Web pages to creating complete games and utilities that

can be executed over the Internet. Some applets that have already

been created with Java include Bar Chart, which embeds a configurable

bar chart in an HTML document; Crossword Puzzle, which enables

users to solve a crossword puzzle on the Web; and LED Sign, which

presents a scrolling, computerized message to viewers of the Web

page within which the applet is embedded. Figure 1.3 shows a spreadsheet

applet running in Netscape Navigator 2.0.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f1-3.gif"><B> Figure 1.3 : </B><I>Applets are small programs that are run from within an HTML document.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Although most Java programmers are excited by the ability to create

applets, Java can also be used to create stand-alone applications-that

is, applications that don't need to be embedded in an HTML document.

The most well-known application is the HotJava Web browser itself,

shown in Figure 1.4. This basic browser is completely written

in the Java language, showing how Java handles not only normal

programming tasks such as looping and evaluating mathematical

expressions, but also how it can handle the complexities of telecommunications

programming.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f1-4.gif"><B> Figure 1.4 : </B><I>The HotJava Web browser is written entirely in the Java programming language.

<P>

Java is actually more than a computer language; it's also a programming

environment that includes a complete set of programming tools.

These tools include a compiler, an interpreter, a debugger, a

disassembler, a profiler, and more. To create a Java program,

you first use a text editor to create the source-code file. You

write the source code, of course, in the Java language. After

completing the source code, which is always saved with a .java

file extension, you compile the program into its byte-code format,

the file for which has the .class file extension. It is the .class

file that the interpreter loads and executes. Because the byte-code

files are fully portable between operating systems, they can be

executed on any system that has a Java interpreter.

Note that many of Java's tools require long file names, especially the long extensions .java and .class. Both Windows 95 and Windows NT allow these long file names, even under DOS sessions.</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

After compiling and running a Java program, you may discover that

the source code needs modification. The Java debugger can help

you find your errors, whereas the Java profiler provides handy

information about your program. If you run into a compiled Java

program that you'd like to see in source-code form, the Java disassembler

will do the translation for you. Java also includes a program

that creates the files you need to take advantage of native methods

(functions written in another language, such as C++). There's

even a program that can create HTML documents from Java source-code

files. Although all the development tools are DOS applications-that

is, they don't run under Windows-they provide a complete environment

for creating and managing Java projects.

<P>

If you're a little confused about how the many Java programs work

together, don't worry about it. You'll get a chance to learn more

about the Java tools as you work through this book. At this point,

just be aware that Java provides everything you need to create

your own applets and stand-alone applications. In the second part

of this book, you'll start learning the Java language, and in

the third part, you'll start using Java's tools to create your

own applets.

Where Is Java?</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

All this talk about Java doesn't do you much good until you get

your own copy of the Java Development Kit (JDK). You'll probably

also want a copy of HotJava and Netscape Navigator 2.0, so that

you can try out the Web pages you create with your Java applets.

Two versions of the JDK are included on this book's CD-ROM.  While

version 1.0.1 has been used for many of the test applets, version

1.0.2 represents Sun's latest installment of the JDK at the time

of this book's completion. However, because the language is constantly

being refined (and was only recently released for  Windows), there

may have been a newer version released since this book was written.

<P>

If you'd like to be sure you have the latest version, you can

find HotJava and the JDK on the Sun Microsystems site, located

at <TT><A HREF="http://www.sun.com">http://www.sun.com</A></TT>. Once you connect up to Sun Microsystems'

home page, navigate to the page shown in Figure 1.5, which provides

access to tons of information about Java and enables you to download

the files you need. (Of course, Web pages constantly change. Sun

Microsystem's site may have changed significantly by the time

you read this.)

The HotJava browser is contained in a self-extracting compressed

file, which you may download from Sun's Web site at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</A>.

After you extract HotJava's many files (there's a ton of them!)

by double-clicking the file, the extraction program uncompresses

the files and stores them in a folder named HOTJAVA.  Once the

files are extracted, you can copy the folder anywhere you like

on your hard disk.

<P>

When you examine the HOTJAVA folder, you'll see the directory

structure shown in Figure 1.7. The BIN folder contains the main

HotJava application (HOTJAVA.EXE), as well as many of the Java

environment's tools, including the compiler, interpreter, and

profiler.  The LIB folder contains a number of other files needed

for HotJava:

Although the compressed HotJava file contains many of the Java

environment's programs such as the compiler and the interpreter,

the Java Developer's Kit contains the complete development suite,

including some files not packaged with HotJava. For example, the

HotJava compressed file doesn't include the Java debugger or the

Appletviewer application, which enables you to view applets without

having to load them into a Web browser. The JDK also comes packaged

with over 20 sample applets. More importantly, the JDK contains

the most up-to-date documentation and tools.

<P>

You can find the JDK on this book's CD-ROM, in the JDK folder,

or you can download the latest version of the JDK from the Sun

Microsystems Web site. On the CD-ROM, the compressed file that

contains the JDK is called JDK.EXE. After copying the file to

your hard disk (or after downloading the JDK from Sun), you install

it in exactly the same way you installed the HotJava browser.

That is, you double-click the self-extracting compressed file.

<P>

When the files have been extracted (it might take a while), you

can move the resultant JAVA folder anywhere you like on your hard

disk, although you'll probably want it on the disk's root directory,

which is where this book's forthcoming examples will assume it's

located. Figure 1.8 shows the contents of the JAVA folder (at

least, the contents at the time of this writing; the development

kit may have been revised by the time you read this).

<P>

<IMG SRC="f1-8.gif"><B> Figure 1.8 : </B><I>The Java Developer's Kit will be in the JAVA folder after you extract its compressed files.



</I></A><P>

<P>

If you examine the folders that make up the JDK, you'll see that

the BIN folder holds the developer tools, such as the compiler,

the interpreter, the debugger, and the profiler. The DEMO folder

contains the many example applets that you can examine to learn

more about the Java language and how it's used. In your JAVA folder,

you'll also find a file called SRC.ZIP. This compressed file contains

the source code for the classes included with the JDK.

<H2><A NAME="Summary"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Summary</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Java just may be the biggest thing to hit the World Wide Web since,

well, the Web itself. As you'll see in the forthcoming chapters,

Java not only provides a way to create secure applications that

can be used safely on the Internet, but the language also represents

a complete shift in the way people may think about their computers

in the future. Because a Java applet can be located anywhere on

the Web yet still be executable on your computer, your computer's

storage may well expand from its tiny hard drive to include all

of the Internet. As Java becomes more refined, and as more people

like yourself start writing Java applets and applications, the

cyber world that is the Internet may never be the same.
