<P>

The one Java tool that you have to use constantly is the compiler,

javac. This is because your Java source-code files are meaningful

only to human readers. Your computer cannot understand them at

all. The compiler's job is to take your program and convert it

from human-readable form to machine-readable form. You've been

using the Java compiler all throughout this book, but in this

chapter, you'll learn some new tricks and tips that'll help you

get the best results from the compiler.

<H2><A NAME="WhattheCompilerDoes"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

What the Compiler Does</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

In languages such a C, a compiler converts source code (the stuff

you write) to machine language, which your computer can execute

directly. Because every type of computer uses a different form

of machine code, programs that must run on different types of

machines must be compiled specifically for each machine. For example,

a C program compiled on a Windows machine cannot be run on a Macintosh,

and vice versa. To run that Windows program on the Macintosh,

the program would first have to be compiled by a Macintosh compiler

(assuming that the source code was portable, meaning that the

code contained no machine -specific instructions).

<P>

With Java, however, the compiler converts your source code into

byte-code files, which are the same format on every machine. This

means that a Java program compiled on a Windows machine will run

equally as well on a Solaris or Macintosh machine. This feat of

digital magic is possible because the Java byte-code files are

not read directly by the machine. Instead, Java's interpreter

reads the byte-code files and translates them into machine code

for the specific machine on which the Java program is running.

<P>

The interpreter does this translation as the applet or application

is running, meaning that the whole process is transparent to the

user. The interpreter, of course, must be specially written and

compiled for each type of machine that wants to run Java programs.

Figure 34.1 illustrates this concept. From the user's point of

view, though, this simply means that he must have Java installed

on his system. The user doesn't need to know anything about the

interpreter; it works automatically when the user views an applet

in his Web browser.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f34-1.gif"><B> Figure 34.1 : </B><I>Because Java programs are interpreted, they can be run on any machine that has a Java interpreter.



</I></A><P>

<H2><A NAME="RunningtheCompiler"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Running the Compiler</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

As you already know, you can run the Java compiler with a command

line that consists of the compiler's name followed by the name

of the file to compile, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac Applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

There are a couple of important things to remember about this

command. First, the Java compiler is case-sensitive when it comes

to comparing source-code file names with the names of the class

contained in the file. For example, if your source-code file is

named shapeapplet.java and the class it defines is <TT>ShapeApplet</TT>,

the Java compiler will complain and not compile the file (Figure

34.2).

<P>

<IMG SRC="f34-2.gif"><B> Figure 34.2 : </B><I>The source-code file name must match the name of the public class defined in the file.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Second, the compiler requires that you include the source-code

file's extension, which should always be .java. Notice that the

extension is all lowercase. If you fail to include the extension

when running the compiler, or if you fail to save your source-code

file with the proper extension, you will get an &quot;invalid

argument&quot; error (Figure 34.3). I'm not sure why Java's creators

insist upon the file extension being present when you type the

javac command line. Most compilers assume the proper file extension

when the file name is typed without the extension. Not so with

Java. Strange.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f34-3.gif"><B> Figure 34.3 : </B><I>A source code name without the proper .java extension is an invalid argument.



</I></A><P>

<P>

Like many of the tools included with java, the compiler recognizes

some command options that you can add to the command line. Table

34.1 lists these command options and their meanings.<BR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<P>

To use any of these options, place the options between the <TT>javac</TT>

command and the source file name, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac options filename.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the following sections, you'll look at each of the compiler

options in detail. In some cases, you'll even get some hands-on

experience.

<H3><A NAME="SettingtheClassPath">

Setting the Class Path</A></H3>

<P>

In order to compile an applet, the compiler usually needs to draw

upon other already compiled files. These files might be files

that you've created for custom classes or they may be the class

files that make up the class hierarchy of the class you're compiling.

For example, when you derive your applet from Java's <TT>Applet</TT>

class, the compiler needs to know about the <TT>Applet</TT> class

in order to fully compile your applet. Moreover, because Java's

<TT>Applet</TT> class itself is a subclass of yet other Java classes,

the compiler needs to bring in many different class files. Obviously,

before the compiler can access these class files, it has to know

where they are.

<P>

Normally, when you compile a program, the compiler finds classes

using the current setting of your system's CLASSPATH variable,

whose default value is the folder that contains Java's classes.

Java will also look in the active folder (the one you're in when

you type the <TT>javac</TT> command line). However, you can change

the setting of CLASSPATH temporarily for the current compilation

by using the <TT>-classpath</TT> option, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -classpath path FileName.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In the above line, <TT>path</TT> is the path you want to include,

each separated by a semicolon. For example, assuming that you

installed Java in a folder called C:\JAVA and that your own classes

are in the C:\CLASSES folder, the following line compiles your

program using the same settings the compiler would use by default:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -classpath c:\java\lib\classes.zip;c:\classes FileName.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Notice that Java's classes are in a file called CLASSES.ZIP. You

must include this file name in the path in order for the compiler

to find the classes it needs to successfully compile your applet.

<H3><A NAME="SpecifyingtheTargetDirectory">

Specifying the Target Directory</A></H3>

<P>

When you run javac by typing the <TT>javac Applet.java</TT> command

line, the compiler reads the source-code file (or files), converts

it to byte-code form, and stores the resultant .CLASS file in

the directory from which the compiler was run. You can control

this target directory by specifying the <TT>-d</TT> command option,

like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

-d directory

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

In this command, <TT>directory</TT> is the directory in which

you want the output files (.CLASS files) stored.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleSettingtheTargetDirectory">

Example: Setting the Target Directory</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose you have your Java source code files (the ones with the

.java extension) in a folder called C:\CLASSES, as you have for

the applets you've created in this book. Now you want to have

the .CLASS files that are created by the Java compiler placed

in a subdirectory of CLASSES called COMPILED. You'd first create

the subdirectory with the command <TT>md compiled</TT>. Then you'd

issue the following command:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -d c:\classes\compiled applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Following the <TT>javac</TT> command are the <TT>-d</TT> option,

the name of the directory in which to store the output files,

and the Java source-code file to compile.

<P>

The directory name is either a full path or a path relative to

your current directory. For example, if you're current directory

is c:\CLASSES, when you type the above command, you can shorten

the directory name, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -d compiled applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="CreatingDebuggingTables">

Creating Debugging Tables</A></H3>

<P>

To get the most out of a debugger, your programs need to be compiled

in a special way, so that debugging information is included in

the compiled byte-code files. The compiler switch that turns this

option on is <TT>-g</TT>, and you use it like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -g applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

As you can see, the only thing extra here is the <TT>-g</TT> option

itself, which requires no additional arguments.

<P>

You may decide that it would be cool to use the <TT>-g</TT> option

all the time, so that your programs are always loaded with debugging

information. Don't do it. This wouldn't be a good idea because

programs with debugging information are not only a bit larger

than programs without the debugging information, but also tend

to run slower. The larger the program is, the more debugging information

the <TT>-g</TT> option adds to the file.

<H3><A NAME="ExampleAddingDebuggingTablestoanApplet">

Example: Adding Debugging Tables to an Applet</A></H3>

<P>

To test the <TT>-g</TT> option, copy the ShapeApplet.java file

from the CHAP34 folder on this book's CD-ROM to your CLASSES directory.

Then, compile the file with the following command:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac ShapeApplet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Now, check the size of the ShapeApplet.class file. It should be

1,334 bytes.

<P>

Next, compile the applet again, this time using the <TT>-g</TT>

option, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -g ShapeApplet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

When you check the file size this time, you'll find it's 1,612

bytes, over 20% larger. The extra size is caused by the additional

debugging information the compiler has stored in the .CLASS file.

<H3><A NAME="SuppressingWarnings">

Suppressing Warnings</A></H3>

<P>

Sometimes, when the Java compiler finds something questionable

in your code, it issues a warning. Warnings represent the kind

of errors that don't prevent a program from compiling properly,

but that may generate a runtime error or just be bad programming

practice. Because warnings are not critical to the compilation

process, Java enables you to turn them off. You might do this,

for example, when you already know about the problems that are

creating the warnings. To turn off the warnings, you use the <TT>-nowarn</TT>

option, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -nowarn applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Like the <TT>-g</TT> option, <TT>-nowarn</TT> requires no additional

arguments.

<P>

<CENTER>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>TIP</B></TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

You can use more than one command-line option at a time. For example, you can both turn on debugging information and set the target directory with a command like this: javac -g -d c:\classes applet.java.</BLOCKQUOTE>



</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="OptimizingaProgram">

Optimizing a Program</A></H3>

<P>

When a compiler runs, it reads in source code and converts that

source code to some other format, in Java's case, a byte-code

file. As a programmer, though, you know that there are many ways

to accomplish the same task in a program. A compiler doesn't normally

take this sort of thing under consideration when it's working,

though. It generates its output the same way for every source-code

file.

<P>

However, the javac compiler knows how to perform certain types

of optimization on your programs, but it only does so when asked.

(And don't forget to say pretty please). To tell the Java compiler

to optimize your program, you use the <TT>-O</TT> option, like

this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -O applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The <TT>-O</TT> option requires no arguments.

<P>

Notice that the letter after the hyphen is an uppercase O. A lowercase

o will not work. Also, be aware that compiling with the optimizing

option may make the resulting .CLASS file incompatible with some

other Java tools. For this reason, optimizing should be done only

when compiling the program for the final time.

<H3><A NAME="SwitchingOnVerboseOutput">

Switching On Verbose Output</A></H3>

<P>

When you run the Java compiler with no command-line option, the

compiler runs and performs its task without displaying any sort

of information on the screen (unless the program contains errors).

With a large program that takes a while to compile, you may want

to know what's going on behind your back, if for no other reason

than to reassure yourself that everything is going okay. You can

make the compiler report to you as it works by using the <TT>-verbose</TT>

option, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

javac -verbose applet.java

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

When you add this command-line option, the compiler will tell

you which files it's loading and compiling. It'll even tell you

how long each step took to complete (Figure 34.4).

<P>

<IMG SRC="f34-4.gif"><B> Figure 34.4 : </B><I>When you use the -verbose option, the compiler reports to you every step of the way.

<P>

The compiler is one of the most important of the Java tools, because

without it you'd be unable to convert your source-code files into

byte-code files, which are the only kind of files that Java's

interpreter understands. Ordinarily, you can run the compiler

simply by typing the command <TT>javac</TT> followed by the name

of the file you want to compile. However, javac also recognizes

a number of options that you can add to the command line. These

include options to set directories, to optimize the program, to

add debugging information, and to display status information as

the compiler works. In the next chapter, you learn about the compiler's

counter-part, the interpreter, which reads the files created by

the compiler in order to run the program.
