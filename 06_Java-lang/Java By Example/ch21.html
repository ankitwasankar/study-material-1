Next in the long list of Java controls are the scrollbar and canvas

controls, which are represented by the <TT>Scrollbar</TT> and

<TT>Canvas</TT> classes. Using a scrollbar, you can enable the

user to choose values from a slider or even set up your own scrolling

displays. The canvas control, on the other hand, enables you to

draw and display graphics in an applet. In this chapter, you'll

get a handle on both of these handy controls.

<H2><A NAME="Scrollbars"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>

Scrollbars</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

Practically every application that runs under Windows supports

scrollbars. In most cases, you use a scrollbar to move to different

portions of a document. However, a good alternative use for these

controls is selecting a value from a range. Although scrollbars

are not as common in applets, Java does include a class for adding

scrollbars to your programs. To create a scrollbar, you first

call the <TT>Scrollbar</TT> class's constructor, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar(orientation,

    start, page, min, max);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The constructor's five arguments are the scrollbar's orientation

(can be <TT>Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL</TT> or <TT>Scrollbar.VERTICAL</TT>),

the starting setting for the scrollbar, the scrollbar's page size

(the amount the display scrolls when the user clicks above or

below the scroll box), and the minimum and maximum values represented

by the scrollbar.

<P>

After creating the scrollbar object, you add it to the applet

by calling the <TT>add()</TT> method, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

add(scrollbar);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ExampleCreatingaScrollbar">

Example: Creating a Scrollbar</A></H3>

<P>

Suppose you need to create a scrollbar that'll enable the user

to select a value from 1 to 100. You can create such a scrollbar

like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Scrollbar scrollbar =

    new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 50, 0, 1, 100);

add(scrollbar);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The constructor's first argument tells Java that the scrollbar

should be drawn horizontally on the display. The second argument

tells Java that you want the scrollbar to start off set to the

value of 50. The third argument is the page size, which represents

the area in the slider covered by the scroll box. Finally, the

fourth and fifth arguments give the scrollbar a minimum value

of 1 and a maximum value of 100.

<P>

These settings enable the user to select a value from 1 to 100.

So, why is the scrollbar's page size set to zero? Doing this forces

the scroll box in the scrollbar to center on the selected value.

It also enables the user to select the maximum value of 100. To

understand why this is necessary, imagine that the scrollbar's

scroll box represents the page of data that's currently displayed

(such as in a word processor document). The scroll box then starts

on the selected value and ends on the selected value plus the

page size. Figure 21.1 illustrates this concept. The scrollbar

in the figure was created like this:

<P>

<IMG SRC="f21-1.gif"><B> Figure 21.1 : </B><I>The scroll box covers an area from the selected value to the selected value plus the page size.



</I></A><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Scrollbar scrollbar =

    new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 50, 10, 1, 100);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Because the scrollbar's starting value is 50, and the scrollbar's

page size is 10, the scroll box covers the area of the slider

from 50 to 60. If the user were to drag the scroll box to its

maximum value, the scroll box would cover the area in the slider

from 90 to 100, as shown in Figure 21.2. In this case, the page

size of 10 makes it impossible for the user to actually select

the value of 100. This is because, if the user could select the

value 100, the scrollbox would have to cover the slider area from

100 to 110. But, the scrollbar's maximum value is 100.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f21-2.gif"><B> Figure 21.2 : </B><I>This maximum setting starts at 90 and goes to 90 plus the page size, which equals the maximum value <r>of 100.



</I></A><P>

<P>

When using a scrollbar to select specific values rather than areas

of a document, you can either set the page size to zero or set

the maximum to the maximum you want plus the page size. Both of

these scrollbars will operate the same way:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Scrollbar scrollbar =

    new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 50, 10, 1, 110);

Scrollbar scrollbar =

    new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 50, 0, 1, 100);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Figure 21.3 shows the scrollbar produced by either of the above

examples. Notice that the scroll box is now centered on 50. When

the scrollbox is at its maximum position now, it indicates a value

of 100.

<P>

<IMG SRC="f21-3.gif"><B> Figure 21.3 : </B><I>This scrollbar enables the user to select any value within its minimum and maximum range.



</I></A><P>

<H3><A NAME="RespondingtoaScrollbar">

Responding to a Scrollbar</A></H3>

<P>

Because of the many different types of events a scrollbar generates,

you need to capture its events in the class's <TT>handleEvent()</TT>

method, rather than in <TT>action()</TT>, as you did with other

controls. What's <TT>handleEvent()</TT>? Like <TT>action()</TT>,

<TT>handleEvent()</TT> is a method that's defined in one of your

applet's superclasses (in this case, <TT>Component</TT>). The

<TT>handleEvent()</TT> method handles all the specific event messages

that are generated by the typical windowing system. Table 21.1

lists some of the events to which the <TT>handleEvent()</TT> method

can respond.<BR>

As you can see from the list in Table 21.1, there are five event

messages associated with a scrollbar. These messages are <TT>SCROLL_ABSOLUTE</TT>,

<TT>SCROLL_LINE_DOWN</TT>, <TT>SCROLL_LINE_UP</TT>, <TT>SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN</TT>,

and <TT>SCROLL_PAGE_UP</TT>. You can respond to these event messages

when you want to customize how the scrollbar functions. (You learn

how to handle event messages in <A HREF="ch25.html" >Chapter 25</A>, &quot;Mouse and Keyboard

Events.&quot;) However, you don't need to get into such details

when you just need to know where the user set the scrollbar. Instead,

you can override <TT>handleEvent()</TT> and check for the scrollbar

object in that method. If the user generates an event with the

scrollbar, you can then call the scrollbar's methods to determine

what change was made. Table 21.2 lists the most useful methods

of the <TT>Scrollbar</TT> class:<BR>

Now that you know how to use a scrollbar, you can put together

an applet that demonstrates the concepts involved. Listing 21.1

is just such an applet. Called ScrollbarApplet, this applet enables

you to manipulate a scrollbar with your mouse and see the results

on the screen. Figure 21.4 shows the applet when it first starts

up.

<P>

There are two things that you should be sure to notice in ScrollbarApplet.

First, notice that the scrollbar isn't just added to the applet.

It is, instead, added to the applet after the applet's layout

manager has been set. This is because the size of the control

bar is dependent upon the active layout manager and how the control

is added to the manager. (For more information on layout managers,

see <A HREF="ch22.html" >Chapter 22</A>, &quot;Panels and the Layout Manager.&quot; By

creating a BorderLayout manager and adding the horizontal scrollbar

to the &quot;North&quot; position, you get a scrollbar the stretches

across the top of the applet. Failure to place the scrollbar properly

in an appropriate layout manager will result in a useless scrollbar

like the one shown in Figure 21.5.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="Canvases">

Canvases</A></H3>

<P>

Canvases are nothing more than areas on which you can draw. You

can combine canvases with other types of components, such as buttons,

in order to build layouts that that are attractive, as well as

functional. The first step in creating a canvas is to call the

<TT>Canvas</TT> class's constructor, like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Canvas canvas = new Canvas();

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The <TT>Canvas</TT> constructor requires no arguments.

<P>

Once you have the canvas created, you add it to your layout just

as you would any other component, by calling the <TT>add()</TT>

method:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

add(canvas);

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ExampleUsingaCanvasinanApplet">

<P>

To end this chapter, take a look at Listing 21.2, which is an

applet that creates a canvas class and uses the class to display

a colored area on the screen. When you run the applet with Appletviewer,

you see the window shown in Figure 21.6. The applet displays two

components: a button at the top of the applet and a canvas below

the button. When you click the button, the canvas changes color.

Often, you'll want to derive your own custom canvas class from Java's <TT>Canvas</TT> class. Then, you can more easily control what's drawn in the canvas, by overriding the canvas's <TT>paint()</TT> method. This is the approach that's used in the 
CanvasApplet applet.

Most often, you see scrollbars being used to manipulate such controls

as scrolling lists and text areas. However, scrollbars also enable

you to create a reasonable facsimile of a Windows 95 slider control,

which enables the user to select a value from a given range. Remember

that you need to use the appropriate layout manager in order for

the scrollbar to be drawn properly. Unlike scrollbars, canvases

aren't usually used to obtain input from the user (although they

do generate some types of event messages). Instead, canvases enable

you to create graphical areas in your applets.
