About the Authors</H1>
</CENTER>
<P><B>DAVIS CHAPMAN</B> first began programming computers while working on his master's
degree in music composition. Writing applications for computer music, he discovered
that he enjoyed designing and developing computer software. It wasn't long before
he came to the realization that he stood a much better chance of eating if he stuck
with his new-found skill and demoted his hard-earned status as a &quot;starving artist&quot;
to a part-time hobby. Since that time, Davis has focused on the art of software design
and development, with a strong emphasis on the practical application of client/server
technology. Davis is the lead author of <I>Web Development with Visual Basic 5</I>
and <I>Building Internet Applications with Delphi 2</I>. Davis is also a contributing
author of <I>Special Edition Using Active Server Pages</I> and <I>Running a Perfect
Web Site, Second Edition</I>. He has been a consultant working and living in Dallas,
Texas, for the past eight years, and he can be reached at <A HREF="mailto:davischa@onramp.net">davischa@onramp.net</A>.</P>
<P>
<H4>Contributing Author</H4>
<P><B>JON BATES</B> has worked on a whole range of commercial, industrial, and military
software development projects worldwide over the past fifteen years. He is currently
working as a self-employed software design consultant and contract software developer,
specializing in Visual C++ application development for Windows NT/95/98.</P>
<P>Jon began his career writing computer games for popular microcomputers and has
since worked with a number of operating systems, such as CPM, DOS, TRIPOS, UNIX,
and Windows, and a number of Assembly, third-generation, and object-oriented languages.</P>
<P>He has written system and application software as diverse as device drivers, email,
production modeling, motion video, image analysis, network and telecommunications,
data capture, control systems, estimating and costing, and visualization software.
He has also written a number of technical articles for computing journals on a range
of topics.</P>
<P>Jon lives with his wife, Ruth, and dog, Chaos, in the middle of cool Britannia.
When not playing with computers, he likes to sleep and dream of fractals.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Introduction</H1>
<P>Welcome to Visual C++. Over the next 21 days, you will learn how to use the features
that Microsoft has built into its C++ development environment to enable you to create
very advanced applications for the Windows and NT platforms. When Microsoft's developers
first came up with the idea behind Visual C++, they decided to take their world-class
C++ compiler and create a development environment and set of tools that would enable
developers to create Windows applications with a level of ease and speed that was
unheard of among C++ development environments. Since that first version, Microsoft
has continued to improve the tools that are a part of Visual C++ to make it even
easier to create Windows applications. As Microsoft has introduced new technologies
into the Windows platforms, it has also introduced tools into the Visual C++ suite
to make it easy to integrate these new technologies into your applications.</P>
<P>If you are new to C++, don't worry. I've tried to make it easy for you to learn
the C++ programming language while also learning how to build applications using
the Visual C++ tools. Just in case you find yourself having trouble understanding
some aspect of C++, I've included a brief overview of the programming language in
Appendix A, &quot;C++ Review.&quot;</P>
<P>If you've looked at previous versions of this book, you might notice that I've
completely rewritten the entire book. Our goal with this new version is not just
to introduce you to and guide you through the various tools and resources that you
will use to build applications with Visual C++; I've also tried to include a great
deal more detail about the various options that are available to you with each of
the features that are covered. This way, you'll be able to get a lot of use out of
this book long after the initial 21 days.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Heading1"></A>How This Book Is Organized</H2>
<P>This book is organized in weeks, with each set of seven days set off into a part
unto itself. However, even though the book is organized in weeks, the topics are
not neces-sarily organized that way.</P>
<P>For the first week, you'll be covering the basics of building applications with
Visual C++. You'll learn how to use designers to design your application windows.
You'll learn how to use various controls available to you as a Windows application
developer. You'll also learn a lot about the Visual C++ development environment and
the tools that it makes available to you.</P>
<P>By the time you begin the second week, you'll be doing more and more programming,
as the topics become more involved. You'll still be using the Visual C++ tools to
construct your applications, but the programming code will be getting a little more
involved. You'll also start learning about more advanced topics, such as displaying
graphics and creating SDI and MDI applications. Toward the end of the second week,
you'll begin to work with databases. This topic spills over into the third and final
week.</P>
<P>In the third week, you'll learn how to create your own modules, DLLs, and ActiveX
controls. You'll also learn how to build multitasking applications, which perform
multiple tasks at a time. Finally, you'll learn how to integrate Microsoft Internet
Explorer, and the ActiveX controls it provides, into your applications so that you
can extend your applications over the Internet.</P>
<P>After you finish the third week, you'll be ready to tackle the world of Windows
programming with Visual C++. You'll have the skills and know-how required to build
most Windows applications available today.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Heading2"></A>Conventions Used in This Book</H2>
<P>While you are reading this book, you will probably notice a couple conventions
that have been used to make it easier for you to learn the topic being discussed.</P>
<P>All the source code in this book is provided in a monospaced font, as shown in
Listing 0.1. This includes all the source code from the applications that you will
be building and illustrations of how various functions can be used. Whenever you
are adding new code, or changing code in a function with other code already there,
the line numbers of the code that you add or change will be pointed out in the text.</P>
<P>
<H4>LISTING 0.1. SOME SAMPLE CODE.</H4>
<PRE>1: void main()
2: {
3:     // if you are adding or changing code in an existing
4:     // code snippet, I will point out the line numbers in the text<B>.</B>
5: }</PRE>
<P>If a topic needs special attention, it will be set apart from the rest of the
text by one of several special markers:</P>
<P>

<UL>
	<LI>Notes
	<P>
	<LI>Tips
	<P>
	<LI>Cautions
</UL>

<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Notes offer a deeper explanation of a topic or explain interesting
or important points.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>TIP:</STRONG> Tips are pieces of information that can make things easier.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<STRONG>CAUTION:</STRONG> Cautions warn you about traps that you will want to avoid.
<HR>
</P>
<P>At the end of each day, you'll find a short quiz and one or two exercises to help
make sure that you learned the topic you were studying. Don't worry--just in case
you need the answers to the quizzes and some guidance when building the exercises,
the solutions are provided in Appendix B, &quot;Answers.&quot;</P>

<P>Enough said! You didn't buy this book to read about this book. You bought this
book to learn how to use Visual C++ to build Windows applications. So go ahead and
flip the page and get started programming...</P>
